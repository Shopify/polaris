# SortButton

The SortButton is a child component of the IndexFilters component. Its purpose is to handle which column the data is being sorted by, and which direction the data is being sorted in.

This component is purely presentational, so the backend logic to actually sort the data will need to be written by the consumer.

## Best practices

Only to be used within the Tab component.
