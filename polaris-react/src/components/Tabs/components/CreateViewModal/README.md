# CreateViewModal

The CreateViewModal is a child component of the IndexFilters component, and is displayed when a merchant interacts with the "Add a view" Tab. Unsurprisingly, it will allow a merchant to add a new view to the current screen.

This component is purely presentational, so the backend logic to save the view will need to be written by the consumer.

## Best practices

Only to be used within the IndexFilters component.
