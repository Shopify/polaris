# RenameViewModal

The RenameViewModal is a child component of the Tab, and is displayed when a merchant interacts with the "Rename view" option within the ActionList of a Tab. Unsurprisingly, it will allow a merchant to rename that particular view.

This component is purely presentational, so the backend logic to save the view will need to be written by the consumer.

## Best practices

Only to be used within the Tab component.
