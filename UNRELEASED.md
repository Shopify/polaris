### Breaking changes

- Update the base font size to `100%` from `62.5%` and update `rem` values accordingly, along with `pxtorem` `rootValue` ([#4794](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/4794))

### Enhancements
- Removed `_SECRET_INTERNAL_FilterControl` and `_SECRET_INTERNAL_FilterControlProps` exports. These exports have been deprecated since Polaris v5 and are not part of our stable API, which is why we are removing them in a minor release. ([#4905](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/4905))
