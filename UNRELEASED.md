### Breaking changes

- Updated `react` and `react-dom` to version 16.14.0. This is now the minimum version of React required to use the `@shopify/polaris` library.
- Dropping support for node 10.x
- Dropped support for Desktop Safari versions less than 13.1, and ios Safari versions less than 13.6. ([#4304](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/4304))
- Made `autoComplete` prop in `TextField` a required string ([#4267](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/4267)). If you do not want the browser to autofill a user's information (for example an email input which is a customer's email, but not the email of the user who is entering the information), we recommend setting `autoComplete` to `"off"`.
- `Autocomplete` now requires `Autocomplete.TextField` to be used ([#3910](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/3910))
- Removed ComboBox as a named export on `Autocomplete` ([#3910](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/3910))

### Enhancements

- Added `id` prop to `Layout` and `Heading` for hash linking ([#4307](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/4307))
- Added support for multi-sectioned options in `Autocomplete` [#4221](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/4221)
