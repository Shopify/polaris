## Best practices

Description lists should:

- Contain terms and associated explanations, or descriptions for each term.
- Provide information that isn’t action-oriented.
- Not be an excuse for using unnecessarily complicated or jargon-filled language. Generally, if merchants need a description list to understand the language in Shopify, we should look for opportunities to simplify the language.
- Not be used to upsell merchants on a feature or service.
