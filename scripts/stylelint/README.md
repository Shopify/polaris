## TODO

- stylelint-config rename
  - [x] stylelint.ts
- renaming scripts plugin wrapper to name of the plugin
  - [x] plugin-wrapper -> @shopify/custom-properties-allowed-list
  - [x] check-custom-vars -> customPropertiesAllowedList
- clean up
  - check-custom-vars
  - [x] stylelint
- [x] remove eslint disable
- documentation

## FUTURE
- think about how to keep polaris tokens in sync in both plugin and polaris-react
  - shared token generator function?
- plugin to ensure color-scheme tokens have the same values



## Notes:
- Maybe include in plugin documentation
  Note: We recommend using String.raw`...` instead of double escaping regex patterns.
  e.g. String.raw`\.css` instead of '\\.css'

  Notice: We don't allow `--p-` custom properties because they auto generated by our
  tooling and should never be initialized in CSS rules.
