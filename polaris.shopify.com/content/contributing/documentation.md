# Documenting in Polaris

Everyone at Shopify is encouraged to help write documentation. That includes everything from fixing typos to drafting new pattern guidance.

To write effectively, use a cross-discipline lens. Make sure your content meets both UX and development needs. Before starting, check out our [style guide to the style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVDsHIWhoir2svRjdtSdRbD_ruTz3K1nAJcQLGPVQwM/edit#heading=h.ni67tdntu9cr).

Most documentation about the design system is meant for polaris.shopify.com. However, there may be a reason for the content to live elsewhere. If you're not sure if something should live on this site, the Polaris team can help you figure that out.

Internal Shopify teams usually create documentation for polaris.shopify.com, but we also welcome edits from Shopify's open source community.

If you have a smaller question, reach out in #polaris if you work at Shopify, or the [Shopify Partners Slack](http://shopifypartners.slack.com) if you're an open source contributor. To get help with the strategy for a larger contribution early on, start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/new) with the system community.

## Detailed steps

### Copy editing

Edits related to spelling, grammar, punctuation, or other typos should happen quickly and often. Both Shopify employees and open source contributors are welcome to submit copy edits.

To fix any copy issues on polaris.shopify.com, open a PR in the [Shopify/polaris repo](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris).

Note: If you find copy issues in other Polaris resources, follow the steps for that resource's contribution guidelines.

### Editing existing documentation (Shopify employees only)

To expand or edit existing documentation:

1.  Draft your proposed changes in a Google doc for easy collaboration. We recommend writing in markdown, or converting your file to markdown when finished.
2.  Get feedback from subject matter experts, or someone with high context around your changes (team member, manager, etc.).
3.  Reach out to the Polaris team to review your changes for style guide alignment.
4.  Submit a PR in the [Shopify/polaris repo](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris). Add a member of the Polaris team and at least one other stakeholder as reviewers on the PR.
5.  Once the Polaris team and at least one other reviewer has approved the changes, merge your PR into the main branch.

### Creating new documentation (Shopify employees only)

New documentation in Polaris can range from component documentation, to content guidelines, to pattern guidance.

To create new documentation:

1.  Book office hours with Polaris to share your rationale for why you think this addition would improve the design system.
2.  Once the Polaris team provides feedback, draft the content in Google docs for easy collaboration. We recommend writing in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), or converting your file to Markdown when finished.
3.  Get feedback from subject matter experts, or someone with high context around your changes (team member, manager, etc.).
4.  Reach out to the Polaris team again to review your changes for style guide alignment\
    Note: If, during the initial proposal review, the Polaris team suggests that the content live somewhere besides the Polaris site, you don't need to have the content reviewed for style guide alignment.
5.  Create a new branch in the [Shopify/polaris repo](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris) and submit a PR with your proposed additions. Add a member of the Polaris team and at least one other stakeholder as reviewers on the PR.
6.  Once the Polaris team and at least one other reviewer has approved the changes, merge your PR into the main branch.

### Removing documentation (Shopify employees only)

It's important that inaccurate or outdated information be removed as soon as possible. This helps maintain high trust in Polaris as a source of truth for design system guidance.

To remove documentation:

1. Reach out to subject matter experts, or someone with high context around the existing content to confirm its relevance and accuracy.
2. Create a new branch in the [Shopify/polaris repo](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris) and submit a PR with your proposed changes. Add a member of the Polaris team and at least one other stakeholder as reviewers on the PR.
3. Once the Polaris team and at least one other reviewer has approved the changes, merge your PR into the main branch.
