All Shopify employees, regardless of discipline, are encouraged to contribute to Polaris. No contribution is too small. We welcome everything from copy edits and bug fixes to new components and patterns.

We also encourage our open source community to contribute to the Polaris React component library.

## Contribution types

Generally, we can classify contributions as minor or major. Minor contributions can be made by an individual or a small team, and the solution is often clear and simple. Major contributions usually introduce breaking changes to the system and require greater involvement from the Polaris team.

Specific contribution types include:

- Bug fixes and documentation (minor)
- Icon additions or updates (minor)
- Component additions or updates
  - Style changes (minor)
  - New or redesigned component (major)
  - API change (major)
- Patterns (major)

## Should I contribute?

All contributions should address a known issue or gap in the system. A one-off solution might be right for your particular use case, but design system solutions should add value at scale.

Minor contributions—like copy edits, bug fixes, and icons—are often worthwhile. They are relatively simple to identify and implement, and they improve system quality and trust.

Major contributions typically require more evaluation. This flowchart will help you decide whether or not your solution is right for Polaris. If you’re unsure, you can always reach out to the Polaris team directly.

**[ FLOWCHART HERE ]**

Not every solution needs to be in Polaris. If a unique solution really is best for your users, you can still build with Polaris [tokens](/tokens) and best practices. This ensures that solutions with custom styles update with the rest of Polaris.

## Proposing a contribution

When proposing a major contribution to Polaris, consider the following:

- Have I used the existing Polaris patterns, components, and tokens to their limit?
- Does my solution bring significant value to the admin and to other teams?
- Have I verified its effectiveness?
- What impact could my solution have on existing implementations?
- Do I have the resources (people, time, tools, etc.) to follow through?

Use the [contribution proposal template](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/new?category=contribution-proposals) in GitHub Discussions to start a contribution proposal. Be sure to include any relevant explorations and documentation.
