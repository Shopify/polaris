# Contributing to Polaris

Polaris thrives on contribution and community support. Anyone, regardless of discipline, is encouraged to contribute. No contribution is too small. We welcome everything from bug fixes or new components, to new UX guidelines. So if you find something to contribute, we hope you feel empowered to go for it. The Polaris team is here to help you along the way.

## Who can contribute

Contribution to Polaris looks different depending on whether or not you work at Shopify. Shopifolk can contribute to any Polaris project, including the Figma UI Kit. Open source contributions are welcome for [Polaris React components](contributing/components) and their [documentation](/contributing/documentation).

## When to contribute

Figuring out what and when to contribute is not always simple, especially when deciding between adding something new to the system or going with an existing solution. Check out the [Thinking in systems](/contributing/thinking-in-systems) and [When to evolve the system](/contributing/when-to-evolve-the-system) guides to help you make this decision.

## Where to get help

If you get stuck or want help strategizing a larger contribution, bring it up in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/new). The Polaris team and other members of the systems community will help you out. If you see a discussion where you could guide another member of the community, we welcome you to join the conversation.
