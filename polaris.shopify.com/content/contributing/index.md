# Contributing to Polaris

Polaris thrives on contribution and community support. Anyone, regardless of discipline, is encouraged to contribute. No contribution is too small. We welcome everything from bug fixes or new components, to new UX guidelines. So if you find something to contribute, we hope you feel empowered to go for it. The Polaris team is here to help you along the way.

Contribution looks different depending on if you work at Shopify or are an open source contributor. Those details are outlined below for the different contribution types:

- [Components](/contributing/components)
- [Figma UI kit](/contributing/figma-ui-kit)
- [Icons](/contributing/icons)
- [Documentation](/contributing/documentation)

Figuring out what and when to contribute is not always simple, especially when deciding between adding something new to the system or going with an existing solution. Check out the [Thinking in systems](/contributing/thinking-in-systems) and [When to evolve the system](/contributing/when-to-evolve-the-system) guides to help you make this decision. If you feel stuck, start a new discussion in GitHub.
