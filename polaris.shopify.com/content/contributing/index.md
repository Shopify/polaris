# Contributing to Polaris

Polaris thrives on contribution and community support. Anyone, regardless of discipline, is encouraged to contribute. No contribution is too small. We welcome everything from bug fixes or new components, to new UX guidelines. So if you find something to contribute, we hope you feel empowered to go for it. The Polaris team is here to help you along the way.

## Who can contribute

Contribution to Polaris looks different depending on whether you work at Shopify. Shopify employees can contribute to any Polaris project, including the Figma UI Kit. Open source contributions are welcome for [Polaris React components](contributing/components) and their [documentation](/contributing/documentation).

## When to contribute
