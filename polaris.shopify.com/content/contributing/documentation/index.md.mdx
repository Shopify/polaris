Shopify teams create documentation for polaris.shopify.com, but open source contributors are welcome to make copy edits as well as update or add examples to [component documentation](/contributing/components).

To write effectively as a Shopify employee, use a cross-discipline lens. Make sure your content meets both UX and development needs. Before starting, check out our [style guide to the style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVDsHIWhoir2svRjdtSdRbD_ruTz3K1nAJcQLGPVQwM/edit#heading=h.ni67tdntu9cr).

Most documentation about the design system is meant for polaris.shopify.com. However, there may be a reason for the content to live elsewhere. If you’re not sure if something should live on this site, the Polaris team can help you figure that out.

## Making copy edits

Edits related to spelling, grammar, punctuation, or other typos should happen quickly and often. Both Shopify employees and open source contributors are welcome to submit copy edits.

To fix any copy issues on polaris.shopify.com, open a pull request in the [Shopify/polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris) GitHub repo.

Note: If you find copy issues in other Polaris resources, follow the steps for that resource’s contribution guidelines.
