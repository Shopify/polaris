# Illustrations

Illustration contributions are welcome from anyone that works at Shopify.

Each illustration must be submitted for feedback from an illustrator in #illustration-guild on Slack. Polaris only supports illustrations within the Shopify Admin product and not marketing assets.

## Quick start guide

<!--

This is a placeholder table, quick start guides render here. You can find and edit quick guide content in the metadata (front matter) at the top of this file. The placeholder table is here so the Markdown component that parses these files places the QuickStartGuide component here (see components/Markdown.tsx).
