- Only use buttons that follow the
  [best practices outlined in the button component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button#best-practices)
- Group together calls to action that have a relationship
- Be used with consideration that too many calls to action can cause merchants to be unsure of what to do next
- Be thoughtful about how multiple buttons will look and work on small screens
- Only be used in groups of up to six buttons if the buttons contain an icon with no text
