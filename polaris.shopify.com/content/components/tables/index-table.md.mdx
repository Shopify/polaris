# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

An index table displays a collection of objects of the same type, like orders or products. The main job of an index table is to help merchants get an at-a-glance of the objects to perform actions or navigate to a full-page representation of it.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

Index tables can also:

- Support [customized index rows and columns](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item)
- Include bulk actions so merchants can act on multiple objects at once
- Support sorting and [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) of long lists
- Be paired with pagination to make long lists digestible

---

## Build

Using an index table in a project involves combining the following components and subcomponents:

- IndexTable
- [IndexTable.Row](#index-table-row)
- [IndexTable.Cell](#index-table-cell)
- [Filters](/components/selection-and-input/filters) (optional)
- [IndexFilters](/components/selection-and-input/index-filters) (optional)
- [Pagination](/components/navigation/pagination) (optional)

The index table component provides the UI elements for list selection, sorting, filtering, and pagination, but doesn’t provide the logic for these operations. When a sort option is changed, filter added, or second page requested, you’ll need to handle that event (including any network requests) and then update the component with new props.

---

## Purpose

Shopify is organized around objects that represent merchants' businesses, like customers, products, and orders. Each individual order, for example, is given a dedicated page that can be linked to. In Shopify, we call these types of objects _resources_, and we call the object’s dedicated page its _details page_.

### Problem

Take orders as an example. Merchants may have a lot of them. They need a way to scan their orders, view the different attributes on each order, and find out which ones need action first. In other words, they need a way find an individual order, call up more information about it, and take action on it.

### Solution

Index tables function as:

- A content format, presenting a set of individual resources with multiple columns of information for each
- A system for taking action on one or more individual resources
- A way to navigate to an individual resource’s details page

Because a details page displays all the content and actions for an individual resource, you can think of a resource list as a summary of these details pages. In this way resource lists bridge a middle level in Shopify’s navigation hierarchy.

---

## Best practices

Index tables should:

- Have items that perform an action when clicked. The action should navigate to the resource’s details page or otherwise provide more detail about the item.
- [Customize the content and layout](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item) of their items rows to surface information to support merchants’ needs.
- Support sorting if the list can be long, and especially if different merchant tasks benefit from different sort orders.
- Support [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) if the list can be long.
- Paginate when the current list contains more than 50 items.
- Use the [skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-page) component on initial page load for the rest of the page if the loading prop is true and items are processing.
- Numeric cells and titles should be right aligned with the [Text](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/text) component
- Numeric cells should use the numeric style with the [Text](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/text) component

Index tables can optionally:

- Provide bulk actions for tasks that are often applied to many list items at once. For example, merchants may want to add the same tag to a large number of products.

---

## Content guidelines

Index tables should:

- Identify the type of resource, usually with a heading

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Products
- Showing 50 products

#### Don’t

- _No heading_

</DoDont>

- Indicate when not all members of a resource are being shown. For a card summarizing and linking to recently purchased products:

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Popular products this week

#### Don’t

- Products

</DoDont>

- Follow the verb + noun formula for bulk actions

- Follow the [content guidelines for filter options and applied filters](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters#content-guidelines)

## IndexTable.Row

An `IndexTable.Row` is used to render a row representing an item within an `IndexTable`

- To create an actionable list of related items that link to details pages, such as a list of customers, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/resource-list)
- To present structured data for comparison and analysis, like when helping merchants to gain insights or review analytics, use the [data table component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/tables/data-table)
- To display a simple list of related content, [use the list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/list)

## Accessibility

### Structure

The `IndexTable` is an actionable, filterable, and sortable table widget that supports row selection with [subheaders](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/multi-level/). To ensure that the power of this table is accessible to all merchants when implementing `IndexTable.Row` subheaders, set the following props on `IndexTable.Cell` that are appropriate for the enhancement you are implementing.

Merchants can select a group of rows at once by clicking or <kbd>Space</kbd> keypressing a subheader row's checkbox. To indicate that an `IndexTable.Row` serves as a subheader for 1 or more rows below it, set the:

- Zero-indexed table `position` of the first and last `IndexTable.Row` described by the subheader `IndexTable.Row` as a tuple array on its `selectionRange` prop
- Unique `id` on the `IndexTable.Cell` that contains the subheader content
- Element tag to `"th"` on the `as` prop of the subheader `IndexTable.Cell`
- Subheader `IndexTable.Cell` `scope` prop to `"colgroup"`

To associate the subheader `IndexTable.Row` with each `IndexTable.Cell` that it describes, set the:

- Unique `id` provided to the subheader `IndexTable.Cell` on the `headers` prop of each related `IndexTable.Cell` (contained by an `IndexTable.Row` that's position is within the `selectionRange`) as well as the unique `id` of its corresponding column heading that you provided to the `IndexTable` `headings` prop

### Keyboard support

`IndexTable` also supports multi-selection of a range of rows by keypressing the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key. To select a range, press and hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while you click or keypress the <kbd>Space</kbd> key on a row checkbox and then do the same on another row's checkbox. All selectable rows between the selected checkboxes will also be selected.
