# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Data tables are used to organize and display all information from a data set. While a data visualization represents part of data set, a data table lets merchants view details from the entire set. This helps merchants compare and analyze the data.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Data tables should:

- Show values across multiple categories and measures.
- Allow for filtering and ordering when comparison is not a priority.
- Help merchants visualize and scan many values from an entire data set.
- Help merchants find other values in the data hierarchy through use of links.
- Minimize clutter by only including values that supports the data’s purpose.
- Include a summary row to surface the column totals.
- Not include calculations within the summary row.
- Wrap instead of truncate content. This is because if row titles start with the same word, they’ll all appear the same when truncated.
- Not to be used for an actionable list of items that link to details pages. For this functionality, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list).

### Alignment

Column content types are built into the component props so the following alignment rules are followed:

- Numerical = Right aligned
- Textual data = Left aligned
- Align headers with their related data
- Don’t center align

---

## Content guidelines

Headers should:

- Be informative and descriptive
- Concise and scannable
- Include units of measurement symbols so they aren’t repeated throughout the columns
- Use sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)

<DoDont>

#### Do

Temperature °C

#### Don’t

Temperature

</DoDont>

Column content should:

- Be concise and scannable
- Not include units of measurement symbols (put those symbols in the headers)
- Use sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)

### Decimals

Keep decimals consistent. For example, don’t use 3 decimals in one row and 2 in others.

## Related components

- To create an actionable list of related items that link to details pages, such as a list of customers, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list).

---

## Accessibility

### Structure

Native HTML tables provide a large amount of structural information to screen reader users. Merchants who rely on screen readers can navigate tables and identify relationships between data cells (`<td>`) and headers (`<th>`) using keys specific to their screen reader.

Sortable tables use the `aria-sort` attribute to convey which columns are sortable (and in what direction). They also use `aria-label` on sorting buttons to convey what activating the button will do.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Use tables for tabular data.

#### Don’t

Use tables for layout. For a table-like layout that doesn’t use table HTML elements, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list).

</DoDont>

### Keyboard support

Sorting controls for the data table component are implemented with native HTML buttons.

- Give buttons keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)
- Activate buttons with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> and <kbd>space</kbd> keys
