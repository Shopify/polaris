# Progress bar

The progress bar component is used to visually represent the completion of a task or operation. It shows how much of the task has been completed and how much is still left.

## Best practices

Progress bar components should:

- Give merchants an indication of how much of the task has completed and how much is left.
- Not be used for entire page loads. In this case, use the [Skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/skeleton-page) component.
