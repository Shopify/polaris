# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Badges are used to inform merchants of the tone of an object or of an action that’s been taken.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Badges benefit merchants by:

- Using established color patterns so that merchants can quickly identify their tone or importance level
- Being clearly labeled with short, scannable text
- Being positioned to clearly identify the object they’re informing or labelling

---

## Content guidelines

### Badge label

Badge labels should:

- Use a single word to describe the tone of an object.
- Only use two words if you need to describe a complex state. For example, “Partially refunded” and “Partially fulfilled”.
- Always describe the tone in the past tense. For example, refunded not refund.

The available badges for financial tone are:

- Authorized
- Pending
- Paid
- Unpaid
- Pending
- Voided
- Partially paid
- Partially refunded
- Refunded

The available badges for fulfillment tone are:

- Fulfilled
- Complete
- Partial
- Unfulfilled
- Restocked

<DoDont>

#### Don’t

Don’t use alternatives to existing badge options. Only create a new badge option if there aren’t any existing options to communicate the tone you need.
