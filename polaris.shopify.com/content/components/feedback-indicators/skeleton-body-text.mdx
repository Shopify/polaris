# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Skeleton body text is used to provide a low fidelity representation of content before it appears on the page, and improves load times perceived by merchants. Can be used for content in or outside of a card.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Skeleton body text component should:

- Be used with [Skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-page) when page content loads all at once. Together, these components give merchants an indication of what the page layout will be once loaded.
- Be used on its own, inside any content container component (like a [card](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/card)), and when content loads after the main page load.
- Try to match the number of lines to the content being loaded so it gives an accurate representation.

## Content guidelines

### Skeleton body text

Show static content that never changes on a page and use skeleton loading for dynamic content. Skeleton body text can sometimes be used to represent non-typographic content such as forms. Don’t use placeholder content that will change when the page fully loads.
