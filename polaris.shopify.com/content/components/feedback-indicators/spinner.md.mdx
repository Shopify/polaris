<Lede>

Spinners are used to notify merchants that their action is being processed. For loading states, spinners should only be used for content that can’t be represented with skeleton loading components, like for data charts.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Accessibility

SVGs are often conveyed inconsistently to assistive technologies. The `Spinner` component’s accessibility is also highly contextual. When the parent component is focusable, you’ll need to set the `hasFocusableParent` prop for the appropriate `role` attribute to be applied.

For optimal user experience, use the `accessibilityLabel` prop to let assistive technology users know the purpose of the spinner.

## Best practices

The spinner component should:

- Notify merchants that their request has been received and the action will soon complete.
- Not be used to give feedback for an entire page load.
- White can only be used with small spinners on actionable components like buttons.
- On web, be used in conjunction with skeleton loading to represent non-typographic content. For example, line graphs on the Merchant analytics dashboard.

## Content guidelines

### Accessibility label

Spinner accessibility label should:

- Accurately explain the state of the requested action. For example, “Loading”, “Submitting”, “Processing”.
- Use as few words to describe the state as possible.
