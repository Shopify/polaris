# Text container

A text container is used to wrap text elements such as paragraphs, headings, and lists to give them vertical spacing.

---

## Best practices

The closer the spacing, the closer the relationship between content topics. The closeness visually represents the relationship.

- Use tight spacing to relate content topics to each other
- Use loose spacing to separate concepts that are independent of each other
