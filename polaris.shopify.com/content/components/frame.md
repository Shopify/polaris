# Frame

The frame component, while not visible in the user interface itself, provides the structure for an application. It wraps the main elements and houses the primary [navigation](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/navigation), [top bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/top-bar), [toast](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/toast), and [contextual save bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/forms/contextual-save-bar) components.
