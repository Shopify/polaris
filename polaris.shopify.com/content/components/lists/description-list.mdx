# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Description lists are a way to organize and explain related information. They’re particularly useful when you need to list and define terms such as in a glossary.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Description lists should:

- Contain terms and associated explanations, or descriptions for each term.
- Provide information that isn’t action-oriented.
- Not be an excuse for using unnecessarily complicated or jargon-filled language. Generally, if merchants need a description list to understand the language in Shopify, we should look for opportunities to simplify the language.
- Not be used to upsell merchants on a feature or service.
