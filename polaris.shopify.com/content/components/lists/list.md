## Best practices

Lists should:

- Break up chunks of related content to make the information easier for merchants to scan
- Be phrased consistently (try to start each item with a noun or a verb and be consistent with each item)
- Not be used for lists where the entire item represents an action

## Content guidelines

### List items

Every item in a list should:

- Start with a capital letter
- Not use commas or semicolons at the end of each line

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Red
- Yellow
- Blue

#### Don’t

- Red;
- Yellow;
- Blue.

<!-- end -->

- Be written in sentence case

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

#### Don’t

- Item One
- Item Two
- Item Three

<!-- end -->

## Accessibility

The list component outputs list items (`<li>`) inside a list wrapper (`<ul>` for bullet lists or `<ol>` for numbered lists). By default, list items are conveyed as a group of related elements to assistive technology users.

To group items for layout only, consider using the [stack component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-stack).
