# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

A resource list displays a collection of objects of the same type, like products or customers. The main job of a resource list is to help merchants find an object and navigate to a full-page representation of it.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

Resource lists can also:

- Support [customized list items](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item)
- Include bulk actions so merchants can act on multiple objects at once
- Support sorting and [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) of long lists
- Be paired with pagination to make long lists digestible

---

## Build

Using a resource list in a project involves combining the following components and subcomponents:

- ResourceList
- [ResourceItem](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item) or a customized list item
- [Filters](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) (optional)
- Pagination component (optional)

The resource list component provides the UI elements for list sorting, filtering, and pagination, but doesn’t provide the logic for these operations. When a sort option is changed, filter added, or second page requested, you’ll need to handle that event (including any network requests) and then update the component with new props.

---

## Purpose

Shopify is organized around objects that represent merchants businesses, like customers, products, and orders. Each individual order, for example, is given a dedicated page that can be linked to. In Shopify, we call these types of objects _resources_, and we call the object’s dedicated page its _details page_.

### Problem

Take orders as an example. Merchants may have a lot of them. They need a way to scan their orders, see what state they’re in and find out which ones need action first. In other words, they need a way find an individual order, call up more information about it, and take action on it.

### Solution

Resource lists function as:

- A content format, presenting a set of individual resources in a compact form
- A system for taking action on one or more individual resources
- A way to navigate to an individual resource’s details page

Because a details page displays all the content and actions for an individual resource, you can think of a resource list as a summary of these details pages. In this way resource lists bridge a middle level in Shopify’s navigation hierarchy.

#### A resource list isn’t a data table

On wide screens, a resource list often looks like a table, especially if some content is aligned in columns. Despite this, resource lists and data tables have different purposes.

A data table is a form of data visualization. It works best to present highly structured data for comparison and analysis.

If your use case is more about visualizing or analyzing data, use the [data table component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/data-table). If your use case is more about finding and taking action on objects, use a resource list.

## Best practices

Resource lists can live in many places in Shopify. You could include a short resource list in a card summarizing recent marketing activities. You could also dedicate an entire page to a resource list like Shopify’s main products list.

Resource lists should:

- Have items that perform an action when clicked. The action should navigate to the resource’s details page or otherwise provide more detail about the item.
- [Customize the content and layout](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item) of their list items to support merchants’ needs.
- Support sorting if the list can be long, and especially if different merchant tasks benefit from different sort orders.
- Support [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) if the list can be long.
- Paginate when the current list contains more than 50 items.
- Use the [skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-page) component on initial page load for the rest of the page if the loading prop is true and items are processing.

Resource lists can optionally:

- Provide bulk actions for tasks that are often applied to many list items at once. For example, merchants may want to add the same tag to a large number of products.

## Content guidelines

Resource lists should:

- Identify the type of resource, usually with a heading

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Products
- Showing 50 products

#### Don’t

- _No heading_

</DoDont>

- Indicate when not all members of a resource are being shown. For a card summarizing and linking to recently purchased products:

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Popular products this week

#### Don’t

- Products

</DoDont>

- Follow the verb + noun formula for bulk actions

- Follow the [content guidelines for filter options and applied filters](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters#content-guidelines)
