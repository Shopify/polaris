# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Action lists render a list of actions or selectable options. This component is usually placed inside a [popover container](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/popover) to create a dropdown menu or to let merchants select from a list of options.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Actions lists should:

- Be used for secondary or less important information and actions since they’re hidden until merchants expose them by opening a popover
- Contain actions that are related to each other

## Content guidelines

### Action lists

Each item in an action list should be clear and predictable. Merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click on an action item.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Buy shipping label

#### Don’t

Buy

</DoDont>

Each item in an action list should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context use the \{verb\}+\{noun\} format unless the action is clear with a single verb.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Rename
- Edit HTML

#### Don’t

- File name changes
- HTML editing options

</DoDont>

Each item in an action list should be scannable avoiding unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Add menu item

#### Don’t

- Add a menu item

</DoDont>

## Related components

- To combine more than one button in a single layout, [use the button group component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button-group)
- To display a list of related content, [use the list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/list)

---

## Accessibility

Items in an action list are organized as list items (`<li>`) in an unordered list (`<ul>`) and are conveyed as a group of related elements to assistive technology users. Each item is implemented as a [button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button).

### Keyboard support

- Give the action list items keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)
- When action list items have a role of `menuitem`, navigate through the list with <kbd>down arrow</kbd> (<kbd>up arrow</kbd> to move backwards)
- Activate buttons with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key or the <kbd>space</kbd> key

### High contrast support

- Each item is clearly discernible in high contrast mode
- Each item that is focused and hovered is clearly discernible in high contrast mode
