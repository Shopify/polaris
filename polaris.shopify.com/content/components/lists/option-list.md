# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The option list component lets you create a list of grouped items that merchants can pick from. This can include single selection or multiple selection of options. Option list usually appears in a popover, and sometimes in a modal or a sidebar. Option lists are styled differently than [choice lists](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/choice-list) and should not be used within a form, but as a standalone menu.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

The option list component should:

- Be placed on its own inside a container. Usually the container behaves like a menu, as it does with [popover](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/popover). Don’t place other components within the same container.
- Not be used when a [select component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/select) will do.

## Accessibility

Items in an option list are organized as list items (`<li>`) in an unordered list (`<ul>`) and are conveyed as a group of related elements to assistive technology users.

Controls in simple option lists are [buttons](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button), and controls in multiple option lists are [checkboxes](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/checkbox).

If you customize the option list, you can provide ARIA roles that fit the context. These roles must be valid according to the [W3C ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/) to be conveyed correctly to screen reader users.

- The `role` prop adds an ARIA role to the option list wrapper
