  This component is no longer supported. The new [Tabs
  component](/components/navigation/tabs) can be used as a standalone component,
  but is used primarily within
  [IndexFilters](/components/selection-and-input/index-filters) for navigating
  and creating saved views of filtered IndexTables. Learn more about our
  [component lifecycles](/getting-started/components-lifecycle).

## Best practices

Tabs should:

- Represent the same kind of content, such as a list-view with different filters applied. Don’t use tabs to group content that is dissimilar.
- Only be active one at a time.
- Not force merchants to jump back and forth to do a single task. Merchants should be able to complete their work and find what they need under each tab.
- Not be used for primary navigation.

## Content guidelines

### Tabs

Tabs should:

- Be clearly labeled to help differentiate the different sections beneath them.
- Have short and scannable labels, generally kept to single word.
- Relate to the section of Shopify they’re on. Imagine the page section title is an invisible noun after the tab. For example, the tabs for the orders section are:

  - All
  - Open
  - Unfulfilled
  - Unpaid

The tabs for the gift cards section are:

- All
- New
- Partially used
- Used
- Disabled

And for the customers section, the tabs are:

- All
- New
- Returning
- Abandoned checkouts
- Email subscribers

Where possible, follow this pattern when writing tabs.
