<Lede>

The top bar is a header component that allows merchants to search, access menus, and navigate by clicking on the logo. Itâ€™s always visible at the top of interfaces like Shopify or Shopify Plus. Third-party apps that use the top bar can customize the color to match their brand using the [app provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/app-provider) component and are required to use their own logo.
