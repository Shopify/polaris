    Grid was built prior to layout primitives like columns, inline, and alpha stack. Comparatively, grid is difficult to learn, document, and understand its usage in a codebase.
    The new layout primitives should be used in combination to achieve similar results to grid.
examples:
  - fileName: grid-two-column.tsx
    title: Two column
    description: Use to create a two column layout that wraps at a breakpoint and aligns to a twelve column grid.
  - fileName: grid-two-thirds-and-one-third-column.tsx
    title: Two-thirds and one-third column
    description: Use to create a two-thirds, one-third column layout that wraps at a breakpoint and aligns to a twelve column grid.
  - fileName: grid-three-one-third-column.tsx
    title: Three one-third column
    description: Use to create a three column layout that wrap at a breakpoint and aligns to a twelve column grid.
  - fileName: grid-custom-layout.tsx
    title: Custom layout
    description: Use to create a layout that can be customized at specific breakpoints.
