# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

A text container is used to wrap text elements such as paragraphs, headings, and lists to give them vertical spacing.

</Lede>

<StatusBanner status={frontmatter.status}>
  The TextContainer is a simple layout component which was made redundant by the
  BlockStack component. Use BlockStack with `gap` values of 2, 4, and 5 to
  replicate layouts.
</StatusBanner>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

The closer the spacing, the closer the relationship between content topics. The closeness visually represents the relationship.

- Use tight spacing to relate content topics to each other
- Use loose spacing to separate concepts that are independent of each other
