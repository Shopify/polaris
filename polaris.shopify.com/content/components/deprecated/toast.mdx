    description: Use to convey general confirmation or actions that arenâ€™t critical. For example, you might show a toast message to inform the merchant that their recent action was successful.
  - fileName: toast-multiple-messages.tsx
    title: Multiple messages
    description: Use multiple toast messages to inform the merchant about distinct actions.
  - fileName: toast-with-custom-duration.tsx
    title: With custom duration
    description: Use to shorten or lengthen the default duration of 5000 milliseconds.
  - fileName: toast-with-action.tsx
    title: With action
    description: Use when a merchant has the ability to act on the message. For example, to undo a change or retry an action.
  - fileName: toast-error.tsx
    title: Error
    description: Although error toast is still available and used in the system, we discourage its use. Reserve it for errors not caused by merchants, like a connection issue. Error toast should convey what went wrong in plain language and should not go over 3 words. For all other error message types, follow the [error message guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns/error-messages).
