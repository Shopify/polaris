<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Required components

The loading component must be wrapped in the [frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/deprecated/frame) component.

## Best practices

The loading component should:

- Indicate that the page requested is loading.
- Indicate that an upload has started and the action will soon complete.
- Be used to give feedback for an entire page load or a page mutation like saving a product.
- Be used alongside a component or page element that contains `aria-busy` to represent what is loading.

## Related components

- To indicate that an action has been received, use the [Spinner](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/spinner)
- To improve user experience and reduce the appearance of long loading times, use the [Progress bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/progress-bar) component.
- To better represent loading content, use [Skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-page) along with [Skeleton body text](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/skeleton-body-text) and [Skeleton display text](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-display-text) components.

## Accessibility

The loading component is implemented using the [ARIA 1.1 progressbar pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#progressbar). It outputs an ARIA `role="progressbar"` and uses `aria-valuemin`, `aria-value-max`, and `aria-valuenow` to convey the loaded percentage to screen reader users.
