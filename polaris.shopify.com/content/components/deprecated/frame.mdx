<Lede>

The frame component, while not visible in the user interface itself, provides the structure for an application. It wraps the main elements and houses the primary [App Bridge Navigation Menu API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/reference/navigation-menu), [top bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/deprecated/top-bar), [App Bridge Toast API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/reference/toast), and [App Bridge Contextual Save Bar API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/reference/contextual-save-bar) components.
