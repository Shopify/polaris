    description: Use footer actions for a card’s most important actions, or actions merchants should do after reviewing the contents of the card.

# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

This is the legacy version of the Card component which is in the process of being updated to a more flexible and composable API. Cards are used to group similar concepts and tasks together to make Shopify easier for merchants to scan, read, and get things done.

</Lede>

<StatusBanner status={frontmatter.status}>
  This component is no longer supported. The new [Card
  component](/components/layout-and-structure/card) can be used in combination
  with the new layout primitives to achieve similar results to LegacyCard. Learn
  more about our [component lifecycles](/getting-started/components-lifecycle).

## Best practices

Cards should:

- Use headings that set clear expectations about the card’s purpose
- Prioritize information so the content merchants most need to know comes first
- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections
- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card
- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as an Edit link)

---

## Content guidelines

### Title

Card titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).

### Body content

Body content should be:

- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions are available to them (especially something new). Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Get performance for all your sales channels.

#### Don’t

Now you can get performance data for all your sales channels.

</DoDont>

- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first.
- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something.

<DoDont>

#### Do

To buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.

#### Don’t

To buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.

</DoDont>

### Call-to-action button

Buttons should be:

- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Create order
- Buy shipping label

#### Don’t

- New order
- Buy

</DoDont>

Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the \{verb\}+\{noun\} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Activate Apple Pay
- View shipping settings

#### Don’t

- Try Apple Pay
- View your settings

</DoDont>

Scannable: Avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Add menu item

#### Don’t

Add a menu item

</DoDont>

### Section titles

Section titles should be:

- Informative: they should label the type of content grouped in the body content below
- Like headings: follow the same content guidelines as when you’re writing headings

### Action links

Links should be:

- Used for secondary or persistent actions: links should be used to represent lower priority actions than buttons, or persistent actions that merchants may take at any time (such as a persistent Edit link).
- Clearly labeled: merchants should not need to guess where they’ll end up if they click on an action link. Never use “click here” as a link because it doesn’t set expectations about what’s next.
- Similar to buttons: Follow the same content guidelines as when you’re writing text for buttons.

## Accessibility

The required `title` prop gives the card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users.

If you use the `subdued` prop on a card or section, make sure that the card or section `title` conveys the reason for using `subdued`. This ensures that merchants with low vision, including those who use screen readers, can identify that the content is inactive or less important.

<DoDont>

#### Do

```
<LegacyCard title="Deactivated staff accounts" sectioned subdued>
  <List>
    <List.Item>Felix Crafford</List.Item>
    <List.Item>Ezequiel Manno</List.Item>
  </List>
</LegacyCard>
```

#### Don’t

```
<LegacyCard title="Staff accounts" sectioned subdued>
  <List>
    <List.Item>Felix Crafford</List.Item>
    <List.Item>Ezequiel Manno</List.Item>
  </List>
</LegacyCard>
```
