# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The layout component is used to create the main layout on a page. Layouts sections come in three main configurations. one-column, two-column, and annotated. One and two column layouts can be combined in the same page. Annotated layouts should be used on their own and only on settings pages.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

The layout component should:

- Use sections with white backgrounds for primary content and sections with grey backgrounds for secondary content that is less important
- Center cards on the background when there is no secondary card on the page to stop the content from becoming too wide
- Group similar concepts and actions together in cards
- Separate different cards using a full-width divider
- Structure primary/secondary, two-column layouts so the primary ⅔ section is used for main information and the secondary ⅓ section is used for information that might not be used as often but remains helpful for context or secondary tasks
- Use equal-width layouts with two or more columns when each layout section has the same importance

## Content guidelines

The content that appears in the layout component comes from cards and annotated sections.

### Cards

Content from cards should follow the content guidelines for [cards](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/legacy-card#content-guidelines).

### Annotated section titles

Annotated section titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).

### Annotated section descriptions

Annotated section descriptions should:

- Be used if the explanation or purpose of the associated cards isn’t clear
- Provide instructions for any choices merchants need to make, or explain the purpose of the section
- Be short, no more than 1–3 sentences
- Direct merchants to more content in the Help Center with “Learn more” links
- Not repeat the section title
- Use complete sentences and regular punctuation
