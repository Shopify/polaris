  - fileName: page-narrow-width.tsx

  - fileName: page-with-action-groups.tsx
    title: With action groups
    description: Use action groups for sets of actions that relate to one another, particularly when there are too many to display as secondary actions. Note that these groups will be further rolled up into a single action for smaller displays so that actions do not wrap or overflow the page bounds.
  - fileName: page-with-content-after-title.tsx
    title: With content after title
    description: Title metadata appears immediately after the page’s title. Use it to communicate brief, important and non-interactive status information about an entire page.

## Best practices

The page component should:

- Always provide a title for the page header.
- Always provide breadcrumbs when a page has a parent page.
- Be organized around a primary activity. If that primary activity is a single action, provide it as a primary button in the page header.
- Provide other page-level actions as secondary actions in the page header.
- When the page represents an object of a certain type, provide pagination links to the previous and next object of the same type.

---

## Content guidelines

### Title

Titles should:

- Describe the page in as few words as possible.
- Be the name of the object type (pluralized) when the page is a list of objects. For a list of orders, the page title should be “Orders”.
- Not be truncated.

### App icon

App icons should:

- Provide their app icon
- Only be provided for pages that are part of a Shopify app

### Breadcrumbs

The content of each breadcrumb link should be the title of the page to which it links.

### Page header actions

Page header action labels should be:

- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a page action. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling an action.

- Action-led: they should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants, use the \{verb\}+\{noun\} format.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Create order
- View in Postmates

#### Don’t

- Create
- Postmates deliveries

</DoDont>

- Short: for secondary actions, when the noun represents the same object as the page itself, a verb alone may be used. If there is ambiguity (such as with the verb “Cancel”), always use the \{verb\}+\{noun\} format.

  In the context of the orders list page:

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Import
- Export

#### Don’t

- Import orders
- Export orders

</DoDont>

- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Add menu item

#### Don’t

Add a menu item

</DoDont>
