Layout is the arrangement of elements on a page. A good layout helps merchants understand and find information to complete their goals. To learn more, visit the [Layout](/design/layout) documentation.

#### Layout primitives

All layouts and spacing should be handled using layout primitives. This keeps our components simple, flexible and composable. Our component naming conventions follow web standards for [logical properties and values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values).

<RichCardGrid
  cards={posts.filter((post) => frontmatter.primitives.includes(post.title))}
/>

<TipBanner>
  Layout primitives allow you to specify values for different screen sizes.
  Check out the layout primitives for information on how responsive props apply
  to each component.

#### Layout compositions

Layout compositions are built with layout primitives. Use these components to build common layouts in the admin with the help of sensible defaults.

<RichCardGrid
  cards={posts.filter((post) => !frontmatter.primitives.includes(post.title))}
/>
