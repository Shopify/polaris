# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Callout cards are used to encourage merchants to take an action related to a new feature or opportunity. They are most commonly displayed in the sales channels section of Shopify.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Callout cards should:

- Clearly articulate the benefit of the feature and what it does
- Provide merchants with a clear call to action
- Be targeted to merchants who will most benefit from the feature
- Be dismissable so merchants can get rid of cards about features they’re not interested in
- Use an illustration that helps to communicate the subject or merchant benefit

## Content guidelines

### Title

Callout card titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).

### Body content

Body content should be:

- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions are available to them (especially something new). Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Get performance data for all your sales channels.

#### Don’t

Now you can get performance data for all your sales channels.

</DoDont>

- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first
- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something

<DoDont>

#### Do

To buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.

#### Don’t

To buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.

</DoDont>

### Call to action

Buttons should be:

Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Buy shipping label

#### Don’t

Buy

</DoDont>

- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the \{verb\}+\{noun\} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.

<DoDont>

#### Do

View shipping settings

#### Don’t

View your settings

</DoDont>

- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<DoDont>

#### Do

Add menu item

#### Don’t

Add a menu item

</DoDont>

## Accessibility

The required `title` prop gives the callout card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users.

Illustrations included in callout cards are implemented as decorative images with empty `alt` attributes (`alt=""` ) so that they’re skipped by screen readers.

Use [actionable language](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#navigation) to ensure that the purpose of the callout card is clear to all merchants, including those with issues related to reading and language.
