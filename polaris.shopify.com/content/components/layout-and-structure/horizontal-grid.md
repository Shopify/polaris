examples:
  - fileName: horizontal-grid-with-varying-gap.tsx
    title: Gap
    description: >-
      Use the `gap` prop to set the amount of space between columns. The `gap` prop supports responsive spacing with the [Breakpoints tokens](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/breakpoints).
  - fileName: horizontal-grid-with-fixed-widths.tsx
    title: Column width
    description: >-
      The `columns` property accepts CSS column shorthand syntax, or an array of strings mapping to common widths in the admin such as `oneThird`, `oneHalf`, and `twoThirds`. For responsive columns, use the same syntax passed into an object with the breakpoints.
  - fileName: horizontal-grid-with-set-number.tsx
    title: Number of columns
    description: >-
      Control the number of columns using the `columns` prop. Column numbers can be responsively set using the [Breakpoints tokens](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/breakpoints).
