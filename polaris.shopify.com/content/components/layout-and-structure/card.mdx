      By default, cards have an 8px border radius and uses `--p-color-bg-surface` as the background and `--p-shadow-300` as the shadow. There is padding of `space-5` (20px) around children and `space-4` (16px) for small screens.
  - fileName: card-with-subdued-background.tsx
    title: With subdued background
    description: >-
      Use for content that you want to deprioritize. Subdued cards don’t stand out as much as cards with white backgrounds so don’t use them for information or actions that are critical to merchants.
  - fileName: card-with-varying-padding.tsx
    title: With varying padding
    description: >-
      Use the `padding` property to adjust the spacing within a card. You can also specify spacing values at different breakpoints.
  - fileName: card-with-rounded-corners.tsx
    title: Rounded corners
    description: >-
      Use the `padding` property to adjust the spacing of content within a card. The `padding` prop supports responsive spacing with the [Breakpoints tokens](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/breakpoints).

# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Cards are used to group similar concepts and tasks together for merchants to scan, read, and get things done. It displays content in a familiar and recognizable style.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Cards should:

- Group related information
- Display information in a way that prioritizes what the merchant needs to know most first
- Use headings that set clear expectations about the card’s purpose
- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections
- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card
- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as Edit)
