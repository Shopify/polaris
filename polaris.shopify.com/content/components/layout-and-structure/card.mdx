      By default, cards have an 8px border radius and uses `--p-color-bg-surface` as the background and `--p-shadow-300` as the shadow. There is padding of `space-400` (16px) around children.

    title: With subdued background
    description: >-

  - fileName: card-with-varying-padding.tsx
    title: With varying padding

    description: >-
      Use footer actions for a card’s most important actions, or actions merchants should do after reviewing the contents of the card. For example, merchants should review the contents of a shipment before an important action like adding tracking information.

# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Cards are used to group similar concepts and tasks together for merchants to scan, read, and get things done. It displays content in a familiar and recognizable style.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Cards should:

- Group related information
- Display information in a way that prioritizes what the merchant needs to know most first
- Use headings that set clear expectations about the card’s purpose
- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections
- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card
- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as Edit)
