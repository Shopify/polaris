## Best practices

Media cards should:

- Provide merchants with a clear call to action.
- Always pair text with a visual component, for example, body text paired with an image, video, etc.
- Use media to enhance the written content. The written content should be able to stand alone without an explanation from the paired media.
- Show targeted content toward specific audiences to maximize relevance.
- Be dismissable.

## Content guidelines

- Don’t use media cards as advertisements for your feature. Instead they should educate the merchant about how to accomplish tasks related to the section they’re in.

### Title

Media card titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).

### Body content

Body content should be:

- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions are available to them, especially something new. Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Get performance data for all of your sales channels.

#### Don’t

Now you can get performance data for all of your sales channels.

<!-- end -->

- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first
- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

To buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.

#### Don’t

To buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.

<!-- end -->

### Call to action

Buttons should be:

Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Buy shipping label

#### Don’t

Buy

<!-- end -->

- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

View shipping settings

#### Don’t

View your settings

<!-- end -->

- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Add menu item

#### Don’t

Add a menu item

<!-- end -->

## Accessibility

The required `title` prop gives the media card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users. It can also accept a ReactNode.

Use [actionable language](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#navigation) to ensure that the purpose of the media card is clear to all merchants, including those with issues related to reading and language.
