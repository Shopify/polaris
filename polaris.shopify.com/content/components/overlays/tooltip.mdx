# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Tooltips are floating labels that briefly explain the function of a user interface element. They can be triggered when merchants hover, focus, tap, or click.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Tooltips should:

- Provide useful, additional information or clarification.
- Succinctly describe or expand on the element they point to.
- Be provided for icon-only buttons or a button with an associated keyboard shortcut.
- Not be used to communicate critical information, including errors in forms or other interaction feedback.
- Not contain any links or buttons.
- Be used sparingly. If you’re building something that requires a lot of tooltips, work on clarifying the design and the language in the experience.
