# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The collapsible component is used to put long sections of information under a block that merchants can expand or collapse.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

The collapsible component should:

- Be used for information that is lower priority or that merchants don’t need to see all the time
- Not be used to hide error messages or other critical information that requires an immediate action

## Content guidelines

Collapsible containers are cards with expandable and collapsible functionality, and should follow the content guidelines for [cards](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/legacy-card#content-guidelines).

## Related components

- To control a collapsible component, use the [button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button) component
- To put long sections of information in a container that allows for scrolling, [use the scrollable component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/scrollable)

---

## Accessibility

Use the collapsible component in conjunction with a [button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button). Place the collapsible content immediately after the button that controls it, so merchants with vision or attention issues can easily discover what content is being affected.

- Use the required `id` prop of the collapsible component to give the content a unique `id` value
- Use the `ariaExpanded` prop on the button component to add an `aria-expanded` attribute, which conveys the expanded or collapsed state to screen reader users
- Use the `ariaControls` prop on the button component, and set its value to the `id` value of the collapsible component
