# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The scrollable component is a container for long form content, such as terms of service, that allows for scrolling so merchants can expose more text as they read.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Scrollable containers should:

- Be used when it’s helpful to provide an extra visual cue to let merchants know that content exists below or above the fold
- Only be used for length text such as terms of service or other legal disclaimers and never for instructional or action-oriented text

## Content guidelines

Scrollable containers are cards with scrolling functionality, and should follow the [content guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/legacy-card#content-guidelines) for cards.
