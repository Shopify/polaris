# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Avatars are used to show a thumbnail representation of an individual or business in the interface.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Avatars should be one of 5 sizes:

- Extra small (20 x 20 px): use in tightly condensed layouts
- Small (24 × 24 px): use when the medium size is too big for the layout, or when the avatar has less importance
- Medium (28 × 28 px): use as the default size
- Large (32 × 32 px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such as on a single customer card
- Extra large (40 × 40 px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such as on a single customer card

## Content guidelines

Any time you use an image to communicate a concept on Shopify, it’s important to use descriptive [alt text](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/alternative-text). Doing this is important for [accessibility](https://polaris.shopify.com/foundations/accessibility) because it allows screen readers to describe what’s in the image to people who may not be able to see it.

For avatars, we recommend using a format that describes what will show in the image:

- `alt="Person’s name"` if the avatar represents a person
- `alt="Business’s name"` if the avatar represents a business
- `alt=""` if the name of the person/business appears next to the avatar as text

## Accessibility

### Structure

The avatar component uses a generated scalable vector graphics (SVG) file, which can cause challenges for merchants that use assistive technologies. To create a standard experience, the `<img>` is hidden from assistive technologies by using an empty `alt` attribute, and replaced with a `<span>` that has `role=”img”`.

### Labeling

The avatar component represents content, and should have a text equivalent for merchants using assistive technologies. By default, the value of the `name` prop is used for the alternative text. If different text would be more accurate, use the `accessibilityLabel` prop to replace the value provided by `name`.
