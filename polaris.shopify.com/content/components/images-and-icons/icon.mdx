# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Icons are used to visually communicate core parts of the product and available actions. They can act as wayfinding tools to help merchants more easily understand where they are in the product, and common interaction patterns that are available.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Accessibility

Using icons can be a great help to merchants who have difficulties with reading, language, attention, and low vision.

If the icon appears without text, then use the `accessibilityLabel` prop to give the icon a text alternative. This adds an `aria-label` that’s conveyed to screen reader users.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Pair text and icons for clarity
- Give the icon a text equivalent if its purpose isn’t conveyed in another way
- Review our [alternative text](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/alternative-text) guidelines to make sure your use of icon works for all merchants

```jsx
<Icon source={OrdersMajor} />
<p>No orders yet</p>
```

```jsx
<Button icon={CirclePlusMinor}>Add a product</Button>
```

#### Don’t

- Describe what the icon looks like
- Include “icon” in the text equivalent
- Duplicate adjacent text in the alternative text
- Duplicate information provided programmatically

```jsx
<Icon source={CirclePlusMinor} accessibilityLabel="Circle plus icon" />
```

</DoDont>
