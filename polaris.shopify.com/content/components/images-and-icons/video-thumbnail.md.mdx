<Lede>

Video thumbnails are a clickable placeholder image. When clicked, it opens a video player within a modal or full screen.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Video thumbnails should:

- Be used with a media card
- Use an image that communicates the subject of the video
- Include a video timestamp
- Capture an image from the video to give a preview of the video content
- Be cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio
- Be centered on the subject and avoid cropping of important details, like a person’s head

## Required components

- The video thumbnail should be wrapped in the [media card](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/media-card) component.

## Accessibility

Images included in video thumbnails are implemented as decorative background images so that they’re skipped by screen readers.

The play button is keyboard accessible and the `aria-label` includes a timestamp when the `videoLength` prop is set. For example, an 80 second video reads as “Play video of length 1 minute and 20 seconds”. If no `videoLength` prop is provided, the default label reads “Play video”.
