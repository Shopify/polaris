# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The top bar is a header component that allows merchants to search, access menus, and navigate by clicking on the logo. It’s always visible at the top of interfaces like Shopify or Shopify Plus. Third-party apps that use the top bar can customize the color to match their brand using the [app provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/app-provider) component and are required to use their own logo.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Required components

The top bar component must be passed to the [frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/frame) component.

---

## Best practices

The top bar component should:

- Not provide global navigation for an application
  - Use the [navigation component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/navigation) instead
- Include search to help merchants find resources and navigate an application
- Include a user menu component to indicate the logged-in merchant and provide them with global actions
- Provide a color through the [app provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/app-provider) component to style the background
- The global menu text should contrast with the rest of the top bar and pass the minimum contrast ratio of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines
- Use an SVG file for the logo
- Use a logo that passes the minimum contrast ratio of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines when compared to the top bar background color
- Show the navigation toggle so it appears on small screen

## Content guidelines

### Placeholder content

The placeholder content for the search field should:

- Always say "Search"
- Never include an ellipsis

<DoDont>

#### Do

#### Don’t
