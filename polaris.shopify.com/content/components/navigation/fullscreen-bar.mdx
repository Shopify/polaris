<Lede>

The Fullscreen bar is a header component that should be presented at the top of an app when it is in fullscreen mode. This is designed to ensure a uniform placement for a button to exit that mode. The Fullscreen bar can be customized by adding `children`.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

The Fullscreen bar component should:

- Be presented when an App is in fullscreen mode as a means of exiting that mode.
- Fire an action to exit fullscreen mode.
