# Scrollable

The scrollable component is a container for long form content, such as terms of service, that allows for scrolling so merchants can expose more text as they read.

---

## Best practices

Scrollable containers should:

- Be used when it’s helpful to provide an extra visual cue to let merchants
  know that content exists below or above the fold
- Only be used for length text such as terms of service or other legal
  disclaimers and never for instructional or action-oriented text

## Content guidelines
