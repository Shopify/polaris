# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Tags represent a set of interactive, merchant-supplied keywords that help label, organize, and categorize objects. Tags can be added or removed from an object by merchants.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Tags should:

- Be presented close to or within the input control that allows merchants to add and remove tags

## Accessibility

### Labeling

The button to remove a tag is automatically given a label using `aria-label` so that screen reader users can distinguish which tag will be removed.

### Keyboard support

The control to remove a tag is implemented as a button with standard keyboard support.

- Give buttons keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)
- To activate a button, press the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> key

When a merchant uses the button to remove a tag, it is important to make sure that keyboard focus is managed. Moving focus to the next element in the page is recommended.
