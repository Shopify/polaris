## Best practices

Settings toggles should:

- Include a title
- Include body content describing the experience when the setting is turned on
- Use a badge to clearly indicate whether the setting is turned on or off
- Use a default button for both states. A primary button can be misinterpreted as the setting being turned on.

If more information is needed to explain setting details or functionality, include the [Info](https://polaris.shopify.com/icons?icon=InfoMinor&q=) icon and link to help content or related documentation.

### Usage

The setting toggle component should only be used when:

- The setting is stand alone
- There are two binary options that are “On”/“Off”

If the setting is dependent on other settings, uses progressive disclosure, or has options that are not a simple “On”/“Off”, use a different UI element such as [Checkbox](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/checkbox) or [Radio button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/radio-button).

## Content guidelines

### Card title

The setting toggle title should:

- Be the setting name, written as a noun or gerund (-ing) phrase (“Test mode” or “Automatic order archiving”)
- Represent the experience when the setting is turned on—even if the setting restricts, limits, removes, or hides functionality

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Test mode
- Order archiving
- Self-serve returns

#### Don’t

- Simulate test payments
- Automatically archive the order
- Allow customers to manage returns

<!-- end -->

### On/Off button

The button for the setting toggle should always say either “Turn on” or “Turn off” depending on whether the setting can be turned on or off.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Turn on
- Turn off

#### Don’t

- Enable
- Disable
- Activate
- Deactivate

<!-- end -->

### Supporting content

In addition to the setting description, supporting content can dynamically display based on state. This should be used sparingly and included only if it adds significant clarity or value. For example, “Your customers won’t receive automatic shipping updates.”

## Accessibility

The `SettingToggle` component is implemented as an HTML `<button>` with the `switch` [ARIA role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/switch_role).
The components passed as children will automatically be wrapped in a label element describing the `<button>`. Enabling and disabling `SettingToggle` will update the `aria-checked` attribute to `"true"` or `"false"`.
