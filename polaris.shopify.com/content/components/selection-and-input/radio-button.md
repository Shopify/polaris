## Best practices

Radio buttons should:

- Always be used with an associated label component.
- Be part of a list of radio buttons that:
  - Include at least two or more choices.
  - Are used to have merchants select only one option.
  - Include mutually exclusive options—this means that each option must be
    independent from every other option in the list. For example: Red, blue, and
    yellow are mutually exclusive. Red, blue, yellow, red/blue are not mutually
    exclusive.
  - List options in a rational order that makes logical sense.
  - Have a default option selected whenever possible.

## Content guidelines

### Radio button labels

Radio button labels should:

- Be introduced with a colon or a heading
- Start with a capital letter

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Option 1

#### Don’t

- option 1

<!-- end -->

- Not end in punctuation if it’s a single sentence, word, or a fragment

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Red

#### Don’t

- Red;

<!-- end -->

### Toggle (Android and iOS only)

Toggle labels should:

- Be clear what merchants are enabling or disabling
- Start with a capital letter

Toggle values should:

- Never be labeled

## Accessibility

Screen readers convey the state of the radio button automatically.

- Use the `disabled` prop to apply the HTML `disabled` attribute to the radio button `<input>`. This prevents merchants from being able to interact with the radio button, and conveys its inactive state to assistive technologies.
- Use the `id` prop to provide a unique `id` attribute value for the radio button. If an `id` isn’t provided, then the component generates one. All radio buttons must have unique `id` values to work correctly with assistive technologies.

### Labeling

- The required `label` prop conveys the purpose of the radio button to all merchants
- Use the `labelHidden` prop to visually hide the label but make it available to assistive technologies
- When you provide help text via the `helpText` prop or an inline error message via the `error` prop, the help or error content is conveyed to screen reader users with the `aria-describedby` attribute

### Keyboard support

- Move focus to the radio button group using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)
- Use the up and down arrow keys to change which radio button is selected
