# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The contextual save bar tells merchants their options once they have made changes to a form on the page. This component is also shown while creating a new object like a product or customer. Merchants can use this component to save or discard their work.

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Required components

The contextual save bar component must be wrapped in the [frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/frame) component.

## Best practices

The contextual save bar component should:

- Become visible when a form on the page has unsaved changes
- Be used to save or discard in-progress changes
- Provide brief and helpful context on the nature of in-progress changes
- Save all changes on the page. Avoid scenarios where multiple forms on a single page can be edited at the same time. If specific sections of a page need to be independently editable, use an Edit button to launch a [modal dialog](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/modal) for each section where changes can be made and saved.

## Content guidelines

Messages in the contextual save bar component should be informative, clear, and concise. They should follow the \{adjective}+\{noun} pattern. Don’t use full sentences.

The standard message content is

- “Unsaved changes” when editing existing content
- “Unsaved \{resource name}” when creating a new object

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Unsaved changes
- Unsaved product

#### Don’t

- You have unsaved changes
- Red and white striped shirt not yet saved

</DoDont>

Actions in the contextual save bar component should consist of a strong verb that encourages action. They should not include a noun.

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Save
- Discard

#### Don’t

- Save changes
- Discard changes

</DoDont>
