# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

A choice list lets you create a list of grouped radio buttons or checkboxes. Use this component if you need to group together a related list of interactive choices.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Choice lists should:

- Include a title that tells merchants what to do or explains the available options
- Label options clearly based on what the option will do
- Avoid mutually exclusive options when allowing multiple selection

---

## Content guidelines

### List titles

List titles should:

- Help merchants understand how the items in the list are grouped together, or should explain what kind of choice merchants are making

<DoDont>

#### Do

Pick a shipping method

#### Don’t

Pick one

</DoDont>

### Be concise and scannable

- Use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance
- Keep list titles to a single sentence
- It the title introduces the list, it should end with a colon
- Should be written in sentence case

<DoDont>

#### Do

Shipping options

#### Don’t

Shipping Options

</DoDont>

### Not use colons

<DoDont>

#### Do

If the customer abandons their checkout, send them an email reminder to complete their order:

- Option a
- Option b

#### Don’t

If the customer abandons their checkout, send them an email reminder to complete their order

- Option a
- Option b

</DoDont>

### List choices

Every item in a choice list should:

- Start with a capital letter
- Not use commas or semicolons at the end of each line
- Be written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase)

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Option 1
- Yellow
- Item three

#### Don’t

- option 1
- Yellow;
- Item Three

</DoDont>

### Helper text and descriptions

If your list contains helper text, only the description below the list item should contain punctuation.
