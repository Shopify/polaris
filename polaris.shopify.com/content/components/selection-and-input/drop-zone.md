# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

The drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the files into an area on a page, or activating a button.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

### Drop zone

Drop zones should:

- Inform merchants when the file(s) can’t be uploaded:
  - When possible, use validation errors on drag to detect and explain things like file size limits or file types accepted.
  - Use the [banner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner) with a critical status to communicate errors that happen on the server.
- Provide feedback once the file(s) have been dropped and uploading begins.
- For convenience, allow files to be dropped anywhere on the page by enabling `dropOnPage`.
- Provide a file upload button to allow merchants to select files for upload in a traditional way. Do this by using the `DropZone.FileUpload` subcomponent.

### Validation errors

The drop zone component validates file type by default. File types you wish to accept can be defined by editing the `accept` property. This component also accepts custom validations using the `customValidator` property. When validation fails, the component sets itself to error mode.

---

## Content guidelines

### Client-side validation error messages

Client-side validation errors give instant feedback.

Validation error messages should be:

- Explicit: help merchants understand why their file can’t be uploaded and what they should change to successfully upload their file
- In sentence case: capitalize only the first word in the message
- Concise: use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance. For example:

`File size must be less than 20MB`

`File type must be .gif, .jpg, .png or .svg`

### Server-side upload error messages

Server-side upload errors give feedback after file submission.

Upload error messages should:

- Be displayed as a [banner](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner) with a critical status
- Show the name of the file(s) that were not uploaded successfully
- Describe why the file(s) couldn’t be uploaded and what merchants should change to upload their file successfully, as seen below

```
The following images couldn’t be uploaded:

* “keep-it-real.png” is too large. Try a file size less than 20MB.
* “realer-than-real.zip” is not supported. File type must be .gif, .jpg, .png or .svg.
* “so-so-real.png” was interrupted due to weak network connection, [retry upload](#)
```

## Drop zone file upload

Use file upload with the drop zone component to let merchants select files for upload in a traditional way.

### File upload properties

| Prop        | Type   | Description                        | Default                   |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| actionTitle | string | String that appears in file upload | 'Add file'                |
| actionHint  | string | String that appears in file upload | 'or drop files to upload' |

---

## Related components

- To provide context to upload errors when they occur, use the [banner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner)
- To provide feedback during file upload, use the [spinner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/spinner)

---

## Accessibility

The drop zone component builds on the native HTML `<input type="upload">` element. It includes a visual`<button>` as well as a drag and drop area that can receive keyboard focus.

### Keyboard support

To upload a file with the keyboard, merchants can interact with the drag-and-drop region.

- To give the input keyboard focus, use the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)
- To activate the input, use the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> keys
