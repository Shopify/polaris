## Best practices

Date pickers should:

- Use smart defaults and highlight common selections
- Close after a single date is selected unless a range with a start and end date is required
- Set the start date on first click or tap and the end date on second click or tap if a range is required
- Not be used to enter a date that is many years in the future or the past
- Follow [date format guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics#dates--numbers--and-measurements)

## Accessibility

Some users might find interacting with date pickers to be challenging. When you use the date picker component, always give users the option to enter the date using a text field component as well.

If you use the date picker within a [popover component](/components/overlays/popover), then use a button to trigger the popover instead of displaying the popover when the text input gets focus. This gives users more control over their experience.

### Keyboard support

- Press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key to move forward and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> to move backward through the previous button, next button, and the calendar
- When focus is in the calendar, move keyboard focus between the dates using the arrow keys
- To select a date that has focus, press the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key
