    ## What is pro?

    "Pro", in Shopify's context, refers to a design language that prioritizes efficiency and intuitive interactions, catering to the daily tasks merchants perform everyday.

    It involves using space efficiently to allow merchants to view more data at once. It's about avoiding being verbose and making the interface action-driven with intuitive icons for swift navigation.

    It also means combining [motion](/design/motion), [color](/design/colors), and [depth](/design/depth) to create a responsive and dynamic interface, with clear affordances, that enable intuitive interaction without confusion about interactivity.

    ## Assign meaning

    **Visual language is clear for merchants.**

    Strong meaning is associated when using color. Red means danger, green means go. [Color roles](/design/colors/palettes-and-roles#color-roles) are heightened in the interface and add a layer of detail that merchants can quickly understand and master.

  Leveraging established symbols to identify key functionality helps merchants
  understand the admin at first glance. [Using clear icons](/design/icons) that
  are widely recognized creates a clear and predictable experience.

  and perform tasks without unnecessary distractions.

    ## Increase density

    **Space is optimized while maintaining high usability.**

    [Density](/design/layout/density) in the interface adapts to the task: high density is used in data-rich environments, while low density is employed in focused, detailed areas.

  Information is structured in a clear visual [hierarchy](/design/typography),
  emphasizing important details through variants like size, weight, and color.

<Text>
  Space is used to [create groups](/design/layout/spacial-organization) of
  related information. [Color](/design/colors) adds or removes emphasis to make
  the interface easier to scan and enables efficient decision making.

    ## Craft juicy interactions

    **Interfaces incorporate a sense of realness.**

    Primary interaction points provide a [dramatic visual response](/design/motion) to interaction. Variables like position and lighting change to mimic how physical buttons react when pressed. A hover transition is smooth and unobtrusive, whilst feedback from a click feels more dramatic and visceral.

  Interactions are quick and user-actions provide instant

<Text>
  Detailed interactions, such as
  [animating](/design/motion/creating-motion#animation) a checkbox when it is
  ticked, create a sense of familiarity and reference how merchants interact
  with real-world objects. These animations contribute to making the admin
  interface feel dynamic and alive, whilst making merchants feel more
  comfortable and confident in their interactions.

    ## Make it predictable

    **Objects with similar appearance share a common behavior.**

    Elements that are visually similar behave consistently throughout the interface. Consistency in behavior reduces confusion and cognitive load for merchants.

<Text>
  By using [consistent signifiers](/design/icons#universal) throughout the user
  experience, merchants can effectively apply the concepts they learn as they
  navigate the admin. This enables a smoother learning curve and makes the
  interface progressively easier to use.
