          ## Pro feel

          **Interactions are highly functional, responsive, and effective.**

          The Shopify admin is a piece of software, not a website. Interfaces are easy to understand and navigate, and common actions are offered in their simplest form and are easy to access and consistently positioned.

      </Grid.Cell>

          ## Meaningful

          **Visual language is clear for merchants.**

          When using color, strong meaning is associated. Red means danger, green means go. Color roles are heightened in the interface and add a layer of detail that merchants can quickly understand and master.

          Leveraging established symbols to identify key functionality helps merchants understand the admin at first glance. Using clear icons that are widely recognized creates a clear and predictable experience.

          ## High density

          **Space is optimized while maintaining high usability.**

          Density in the interface adapts to the task: high density is used in data-rich environments, while low density is employed in focused, detailed areas.

        </Box>

          ## Tactility

          **Interfaces incorporate a sense of realness.**

          Primary interaction points provide a dramatic visual response to interaction. Variables like position and lighting change to mimic how physical buttons react when pressed. A hover transition is smooth and unobtrusive, whilst feedback from a click feels more dramatic and visceral.

        </Box>

        <Box padding="400">

          Detailed interactions, such as animating a checkbox when it is ticked, create a sense of familiarity and reference how merchants interact with real-world objects. These animations contribute to making the admin interface feel dynamic and alive, whilst making merchants feel more comfortable and confident in their interactions.

          ## Commonality

          **Objects with similar appearance share a common behavior.**

          Elements that are similar visually behave consistently throughout the interface. Consistency in behavior reduces confusion and cognitive load for merchants.

        </Box>

          By using consistent signifiers throughout the user experience, merchants can effectively apply the concepts they learn as they navigate the admin. This enables a smoother learning curve and makes the interface progressively easier to use.
