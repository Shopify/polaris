## Mobile approaches
There are two ways that Polaris components can show up on mobile devices:
        1. Within a mobile browser such as Chrome of Safari
        2. Within [WebViews](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/web-views) inside the Shopify App via [MobileBridge](https://vault.shopify.io/gsd/projects/43312).

Merchants use the Shopify apps on iOS and Android far more than using the browser on their mobile device. Because of this, we recommend mocking up your experiences as WebViews rather than within the mobile browser.


## What is a WebView?
 
 A WebView is a way in which we can show web content, in this case the Admin, inside the native Shopify App without having to rewrite things using native code. It is similar to an iframe. Doing this allows us to build most things once and ship it to both the web and our native applications on iOS and Android. 

    **Content area**

The main content area of an Admin page is what makes up a WebView. The TopBar, Navigation and Page components all get removed in favor of their native counterparts.

## MobileBridge

MobileBridge is a Shopify technology that allows us to not just use WebViews, but make them feel native, giving merchants a more consistent and high quality experience.

    **Navigation**

    The Shopify App uses standard navigation patterns for the Title Bar all screens and sheets. Determining which pattern to use is as simple as following the decision tree below. You can see all the variants in the [Mobile Native Figma Library](https://www.figma.com/design/Jiogjcxw2JRAzk7ggMUboK/Mobile-Polaris---v2-Components?node-id=50-187&p=f&t=TRz9CStlTreFneT2-11).

  **Modals**

  A main area we leverage this is in Modals. MobileBridge allows us to take the content of a modal and place it inside of a native Sheet, making the experience feel fast and native for merchants. Actions and navigation can be mapped to the native controls and using native patterns.
