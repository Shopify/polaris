## Mobile approaches
On mobile, the Shopify admin utilizes three main approaches: responsive mobile web, native apps built with React Native, and WebViews accessible within the native app. 
 
Most designers at Shopify focus on creating WebViews using a technology stack called [MobileBridge](https://vault.shopify.io/gsd/projects/43312). The MobileBridge project is dedicated to enhancing the mobile 
experience by improving modal capabilities and page titles, making Shopify WebViews feel more native. This involves extracting MobileBridge from the main Shopify app 
to allow other applications, like POS and Balance, to leverage its features. 
 
By using Polaris and Web components, MobileBridge ensures proper rendering in mobile environments and simulates native navigation for a seamless user experience. 
This approach not only enhances the user experience but also supports the integration of Shopify's mobile ecosystem across various applications.



 
    ## Designing with MobileBridge

    **Navigation**

    MobileBridge establishes standard state-based patterns for the top title bar navigation UI on all screens and sheets. Determining which pattern to use 
    is as simple as following the decision tree below.

  States in action can be seen here. You can learn more on the 
  [MobileBridge vault page](https://vault.shopify.io/page/Clean-dirty-states~ysiD.md) and get access to the  components the [Mobile Native Figma Library](https://www.figma.com/design/Jiogjcxw2JRAzk7ggMUboK/Mobile-Polaris---v2-Components?m=auto&node-id=1059-30754&t=XgXohENfHp1d7e28-1).

  **Content area**

  The content area is what you see above, this is where the WebView appears. The only real difference between the WebView and responsive mobile web is around navigation. 

On the left is the Edit order screen through a browser and on the right the MobileBridge WebView, notice the Page navigation component.
