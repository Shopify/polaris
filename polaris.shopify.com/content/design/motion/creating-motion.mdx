      ## Transitions

      Transitions should be smooth and fluid, guiding merchants’ attention and maintaining context as they navigate the interface. They play a crucial role in ensuring continuity in the experience.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="do">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/creating/01-transition-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Search card interface quickly animating into place.
      </video>
      Use transitions to guide merchants’ attention and provide continuity. Ensuring
      transitions preserve the state and context of the interface.

        type="video/mp4"
      />
      Search card interface quickly animating into place.
    </video>
    Animate all elements on a page simultaneously. Overwhelming motion can disorient
    users and break continuity. Animating a single element is often enough to provide
    sufficient context and maintain a sense of continuity.

      ## Timing

      Timing is crucial in motion design. Motion is fast enough to not cause delay, but slow enough to be understood.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="do">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/creating/03-timing-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Tooltip moving to place with a quick animation.
