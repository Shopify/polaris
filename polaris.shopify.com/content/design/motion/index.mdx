    ## Purposeful

    Motion has a clear purpose. It helps merchants understand the interface and the results of their actions, instead of being used as decoration or entertainment.

    ## Responsive

    Motion should be a reaction to merchant interactions, providing immediate visual feedback, and making the interface feel alive and responsive.

  <Small variant="do">
    <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
      <source
        src="/images/design/motion/overview/02-responsive-do.mp4"
        type="video/mp4"
      />
      An animation of a tick mark that mimics how one draws it on a page.
    </video>
    Use motion to provide feedback on merchant actions. The scale of the motion
    should match the scale of the action performed.
  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
      <source
        src="/images/design/motion/overview/02-responsive-dont.mp4"
        type="video/mp4"
      />
      An elaborate animation of the tick mark that fills in the container and rotates
      the tick mark.
    </video>
    Use motion that doesn't correspond to merchants’ interactions and expectations.
  </Small>

    ## Snappy

    Motion should feel quick and subtle.

    A snappy animation starts rapidly, and slows down towards the end, making the transition feel quick while still providing a cue as to where things are coming from, making the motion feel more natural.

  <Small variant="do">
    <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
      <source
        src="/images/design/motion/overview/03-snappy-do.mp4"
        type="video/mp4"
      />
      Quick transition with a dropdown menu moving into position
    </video>
    Make motion feel snappy. This gives the animation a lively and energetic feel
    that doesn’t get in the way of merchants.
  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
      <source
        src="/images/design/motion/overview/03-snappy-dont.mp4"
        type="video/mp4"
      />
      Dropdown menu showing up instantly without a transition.
    </video>
    Use abrupt, instant, or distracting motion, as these make it hard to follow
    along with changes happening on the interface.
  </Small>
