      ## Purposeful

      Motion has a clear purpose. It helps merchants understand the interface and the results of their actions, instead of being used as decoration or entertainment.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="do">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/01-purposeful-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Transition between two menu items, featuring a quick subtle transition that
        animates elements that were already in view.
      </video>
      Use motion to enhance merchant understanding and provide context.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="dont">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/01-purposeful-dont.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Transition between two menu items, featuring a elaborate transition that
        animates all elements that change on the page.
      </video>
      Allow motion to complicate the interface or hinder merchant comprehension.

      ## Responsive

      Motion should be a reaction to merchant interactions, providing immediate visual feedback, and making the interface feel alive and responsive.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="do">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/02-responsive-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        An animation of a tick mark that mimics how one draws it on a page.
      </video>
      Use motion to provide feedback on merchant actions. The scale of the motion
      should match the scale of the action performed.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="dont">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/02-responsive-dont.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        An elaborate animation of the tick mark that fills in the container and rotates
        the tick mark.
      </video>
      Use motion that doesn't correspond to merchants’ interactions and expectations.
    </Column>

      ## Snappy

      Motion should feel quick and subtle.

      A snappy animation starts rapidly, and slows down towards the end, making the transition feel quick while still providing a cue as to where things are coming from, making the motion feel more natural.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="do">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/03-snappy-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Quick transition with a dropdown menu moving into position
      </video>
      Make motion feel snappy. This gives the animation a lively and energetic feel
      that doesn’t get in the way of merchants.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="dont">
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls playsInline muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/03-snappy-dont.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Dropdown menu showing up instantly without a transition.
      </video>
      Use abrupt, instant, or distracting motion, as these make it hard to follow
      along with changes happening on the interface.
