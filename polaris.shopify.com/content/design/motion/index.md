## Purposeful

Motion has a clear purpose. It helps merchants understand the interface and the results of their actions, instead of being used as decoration or entertainment.

<Grid
  gap="400"
  areas={{xs: ['aaaaaa', 'bbbbbb'], lg: ['a a a a a a b b b b b b']}}
>
  <Grid.Cell area="a">
    <Do>
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoPlay muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/01-purposeful-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Transition between two menu items, featuring a quick subtle transition that
        animates elements that were already in view.
      </video>
      Use motion to enhance merchant understanding and provide context.
    </Do>
  </Grid.Cell>
  <Grid.Cell area="b">
    <Dont>
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoPlay muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/01-purposeful-dont.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        Transition between two menu items, featuring a elaborate transition that
        animates all elements that change on the page.
      </video>
      Allow motion to complicate the interface or hinder merchant comprehension.
    </Dont>
  </Grid.Cell>
</Grid>

## Responsive

Motion should be a reaction to merchant interactions, providing immediate visual feedback and making the interface feel alive and responsive.

<Grid
  gap="400"
  areas={{xs: ['aaaaaa', 'bbbbbb'], lg: ['a a a a a a b b b b b b']}}
>
  <Grid.Cell area="a">
    <Do>
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoPlay muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/02-responsive-do.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        An animation of a tick mark that mimics how one draws it on a page.
      </video>
      Use motion to provide feedback on merchant actions. The scale of the motion
      should match the scale of the action performed.
    </Do>
  </Grid.Cell>
  <Grid.Cell area="b">
    <Dont>
      <video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoPlay muted loop>
        <source
          src="/images/design/motion/overview/02-responsive-dont.mp4"
          type="video/mp4"
        />
        An elaborate animation of the tick mark that fills in the container and rotates
        the tick mark.
      </video>
      Allow motion to complicate the interface or hinder merchant comprehension.
    </Dont>
  </Grid.Cell>
</Grid>

## Snappy

Motion should feel quick and subtle.
A snappy animation starts rapidly, and slows down towards the end, making the transition feel quick while still providing a cue as to where things are coming from, making the motion feel more natural.

        An animation of a tick mark that mimics how one draws it on a page.

      Use motion to provide feedback on merchant actions. The scale of the motion
      should match the scale of the action performed.

        An elaborate animation of the tick mark that fills in the container and rotates
        the tick mark.
