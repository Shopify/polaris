## Feedback

Motion can be used to provide feedback, helping merchants understand the results of their actions. It offers visual cues that indicate the result of an interaction, reinforcing merchant's confidence in their actions.

      Animate all elements on a page simultaneously. Overwhelming motion can disorient
      users and break continuity. Animating a single element often can be enough
      to provide sufficient context and maintain a sense of continuity.

## Navigation

Motion can guide merchant attention during navigation, helping to maintain context and continuity. It creates a visual guide that helps merchants understand their path through the interface.

## Loading

Motion can be used to indicate loading states, keeping merchants informed and engaged during wait times. It provides a visual indicator that the system is processing a request, helping to manage expectations and reduce perceived wait times.
