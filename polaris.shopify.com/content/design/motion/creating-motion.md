## Transition

Transitions should be smooth and fluid, guiding merchantsâ€™ attention and maintaining context as they navigate the interface. They play a crucial role in ensuring continuity in the experience.

## Animation

Animations should be simple and purposeful, used to enhance understanding or provide visual feedback.

## Timing

Timing is crucial in motion design. Motion is fast enough to not cause delay, but slow enough to be understood.
