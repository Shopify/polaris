          ## Shadows & bevels

          Shadows and bevels create the illusion that an element is raised above the rest of the interface, indicating that it's interactive or important.

          #### Do

          ![A piece of interface featuring a bevel effect on primary buttons and the main container.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-2@2x.png)

          Use shadows and bevels to indicate important interactions. This will make buttons and other important interactive elements appear more tactile, obvious, and inviting to click.

          #### Dont

          ![A table with a series of text fields and buttons with a notable bevel effect.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-3@2x.png)

          Overuse shadows or bevels, as they will make the interface look cluttered and confusing. They’re meant to be used sparingly and consistently.

        </DoDont>
        <Do>
          ![A series of cards with a consistent shadow effect.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-4@2x.png)

          Use consistent shadow and bevel styles across your interface, to maintain visual harmony and make the interface feel more cohesive.
        </Do>
        <Dont>
          ![Two cards with distinct shadows.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-5@2x.png)

          Use different styles for similar elements. This can confuse merchants about the hierarchy and interactivity of the elements.

          ## Lighting
          Lighting plays a crucial role in creating the illusion of depth. It reinforces interactivity and guides merchant's attention.

          Decrease the brightness of an element when it’s being pushed down in the Z index. When a button is pressed, it goes down.

        ## Layering

        Layering can be used to organize elements and create a sense of hierarchy. By placing elements on different layers, you can indicate which elements are in focus or interactive.

            ![A snapshot of Shopify’s admin page, with 4 level being highlighted. Menu (-1), Background (0) Card with metrics (1) Drop down menu (2)](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-8@2x.png)

            Use layering to organize the interface and guide merchant focus. Higher layers should be used for more important or interactive elements.

          </Do>
          <Dont>

            ![A series of cards with distinct shadows.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-9@2x.png)

            Use too many layers in one screen, as it can confuse merchants and make the interface difficult to navigate.

          </Dont>
          <DoDont className="margin-considered-harmful">

            #### Do
            ![A card with tasks, where the task in view features a gray background.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-10@2x.png)

            Keep most elements on the same layer to establish a visual baseline, and allow for purposeful use of layering, when necessary, to denote importance or interactivity.

            #### Dont
            ![A card with tasks, where the task in view features a drop shadow and a bevel effect.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-11@2x.png)

            Resort to layering as the initial tool for emphasis. Explore other visual techniques first to highlight elements without disrupting the layering system.

          ## Surface depth
          Surfaces can enhance depth perception in an interface by establishing hierarchy and guiding attention.

          Distinct separation between surfaces, depending on the visual boundary, can suggest an indentation or elevation, further intensifying the sense of depth and [spatial organization](/design/layout/spacial-organization).

            ![The bottom of the search results card, featuring a grey background that contains secondary information.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-14@2x.png)

            Use a gray background to de-emphasize contained information. This will divert merchants’ attention towards more important information, as the muted background visually recedes, pushing the contained content into the background.
          </Do>

          <Grid areas={{ xs: ['a a a a a a', 'b b b b b b'], lg: ['a a a a a a b b b b b b'] }}>

                ![A table with products, featuring a yellow background for the first brown, and yellow outline for the main container.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-16@2x.png)

                Use bright or contrasting colors for container backgrounds or borders. This distracts merchants from the main content and creates a cluttered UI. More guidance can be found under [Color](/design/colors).

                ![A card with a footer with a gray background and a distinct bevel effect between the main content and the footer.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-17@2x.png)

                Use unique styles for surfaces, like inset shadows. This makes the interface noisy and creates confusing information hierarchy.
