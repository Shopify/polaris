          ## Hierarchy

          Depth can effectively establish visual hierarchy. The higher an element sits in the Z scale, the more important it will seem. This enables merchants to understand the importance of different elements and guides their navigation through the interface.

            ![A dropdown menu with a shadow that separates the menu from the background.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-1@2x.png)

            Use depth tactically, and to differentiate between primary and secondary elements.

            ![A dropdown menu with a shadow that separates the menu from the background, with an bevel on the item selected.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-2@2x.png)

            Overuse depth, as it can lead to a cluttered and confusing interface. Too many elements pulling attention can disorient merchants.

          <Dont height="100%">
            ![A table with product with a bevel effect.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-3@2x.png)

            Add unnecessary depth to an element. The depth of an element should always be related to its importance or interactivity.

          <Dont height="100%">
            ![A dropdown menu that sticks out of the main container](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-4@2x.png)

            Allow elements to protrude outside of their parent containers. This disrupts the natural perception of depth and hierarchy, leading to a visually confusing interface. Instead, maintain the integrity of parent-child relationship in the layout for a cohesive depth perception.

          ## Interactivity

          Depth indicates interactivity. Interactive elements, like buttons or cards, get more depth to signal to merchants that they can interact with such components.

      </Grid.Cell>

      <Grid.Cell area="b">

            #### Do
            ![Two buttons with a style that mimics real buttons.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-5@2x.png)

            Use depth to indicate interactive elements, so it’s obvious what elements merchants can interact with.

            #### Dont
            ![An unfulfilled badge, and product tags with a style that mimics real buttons. ](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-6@2x.png)

            Give static elements unnecessary depth, as this can mislead merchants to think they’re interactive.

            ![A button with a visual treatment that make it look like is being pressed down.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-7@2x.png)

            Apply intuitive changes to an element's perceived depth upon interaction, like pushing a button down. This provides visual feedback and intensifies the sense of tactility.

            #### Dont
            ![A button with a visual treatment that make it look like is being elevated.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-8@2x.png)

            Apply unexpected changes to an element’s perceived depth. This causes disorientation and makes the interface feel ill-conceived.

          ## Focus

          Depth helps to guide the merchant's focus. By giving more depth to an element, you can guide the merchant's attention towards it.

            ![A modal window overlapping the interface of a customer details page, with a semi-transparent background that separates the modal from the remaining interface.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-9@2x.png)

            Use depth to highlight action and large pieces of information that overlay on top of other information, to ensure merchants see these first.
          </Do>
          <Dont>
            ![A modal window overlapping the interface of a customer details page.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-10@2x.png)

            Rely solely on depth to create focus. Not all merchants perceive depth in the same way, so it's important to use a combination of techniques to ensure your design is accessible to everyone.
