    ## Hierarchy

    Depth can effectively establish visual hierarchy. The higher an element sits in the Z scale, the more important it will seem. This enables merchants to understand the importance of different elements and guides their navigation through the interface.

  </Text>
  <Small variant="do">
    ![A dropdown menu with a shadow that separates the menu from the background.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-1@2x.png)

    Use depth tactically, and to differentiate between primary and secondary elements.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A dropdown menu with a shadow that separates the menu from the background, with an bevel on the item selected.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-2@2x.png)

    Overuse depth, as it can lead to a cluttered and confusing interface. Too many elements pulling attention can disorient merchants.

  </Small>

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Large variant="dont">
    ![A table with product with a bevel effect.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-3@2x.png)

    Add unnecessary depth to an element. The depth of an element should always be related to its importance or interactivity.

  </Large>

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Large variant="dont">
    ![A dropdown menu that sticks out of the main container](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-4@2x.png)

    Allow elements to protrude outside of their parent containers. This disrupts the natural perception of depth and hierarchy, leading to a visually confusing interface. Instead, maintain the integrity of parent-child relationship in the layout for a cohesive depth perception.

    ## Interactivity

    Depth indicates interactivity. Interactive elements, like buttons or cards, get more depth to signal to merchants that they can interact with such components.

  </Text>

  <Small variant="do">
    ![Two buttons with a style that mimics real buttons.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-5@2x.png)

    Use depth to indicate interactive elements, so it’s obvious what elements merchants can interact with.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    ![An unfulfilled badge, and product tags with a style that mimics real buttons. ](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-6@2x.png)

    Give static elements unnecessary depth, as this can mislead merchants to think they’re interactive.

  </Small>

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Small variant="do">
    ![A button with a visual treatment that make it look like is being pressed down.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-7@2x.png)

    Apply intuitive changes to an element's perceived depth upon interaction, like pushing a button down. This provides visual feedback and intensifies the sense of tactility.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A button with a visual treatment that make it look like is being elevated.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-8@2x.png)

    Apply unexpected changes to an element’s perceived depth. This causes disorientation and makes the interface feel ill-conceived.

    ## Focus

    Depth helps to guide the merchant's focus. By giving more depth to an element, you can guide the merchant's attention towards it.

  </Text>
  <Large variant="do">
    ![A modal window overlapping the interface of a customer details page, with a semi-transparent background that separates the modal from the remaining interface.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-9@2x.png)

    Use depth to highlight action and large pieces of information that overlay on top of other information, to ensure merchants see these first.

  </Large>

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Large variant="dont">
    ![A modal window overlapping the interface of a customer details page.](/images/design/depth/overview/depth-overview-10@2x.png)

    Rely solely on depth to create focus. Not all merchants perceive depth in the same way, so it's important to use a combination of techniques to ensure your design is accessible to everyone.
