    ## Visual hierarchy

    Use a combination of shadows and layering to create a sense of realism and
    hierarchy in the interface, guiding merchants' attention and indicating
    interactivity.

    ## Shadows & bevels

    Shadows and bevels create the illusion that an element is raised above the rest of the interface, indicating that it's interactive or important.

  </Text>

  <Small variant="do">
    ![A piece of interface featuring a bevel effect on primary buttons and the main container.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-2@2x.png)

    Use shadows and bevels to indicate important interactions. This will make buttons and other important interactive elements appear more tactile, obvious, and inviting to click.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A table with a series of text fields and buttons with a notable bevel effect.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-3@2x.png)

    Overuse shadows or bevels, as they will make the interface look cluttered and confusing. They’re meant to be used sparingly and consistently.

  <Large variant="do">
    ![A series of cards with a consistent shadow effect.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-4@2x.png)

    Use consistent shadow and bevel styles across your interface, to maintain visual harmony and make the interface feel more cohesive.

  </Large>

{' '}

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Large variant="dont">
    ![Two cards with distinct shadows.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-5@2x.png)

    Use different styles for similar elements. This can confuse merchants about the hierarchy and interactivity of the elements.

    ## Lighting

    Lighting plays a crucial role in creating the illusion of depth. It reinforces interactivity and guides merchant's attention.

  </Text>

  <Small variant="do">
    ![Two buttons, where the one being pressed is darked than the other.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-6@2x.png)

    Decrease the brightness of an element when it’s being pushed down in the Z index. When a button is pressed, it goes down.

  </Small>

  <Small variant="do">
    ![A menu where the item selected featured a light background. ](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-7@2x.png)

    Increase the brightness of an element when it’s being pushed up in the Z index. When a page is active, it goes up.

  </Small>

    ## Layering

    Layering can be used to organize elements and create a sense of hierarchy. By placing elements on different layers, you can indicate which elements are in focus or interactive.

  </Text>

  <Small variant="do">
    ![A snapshot of Shopify’s admin page, with 4 level being highlighted. Menu (-1), Background (0) Card with metrics (1) Drop down menu (2)](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-8@2x.png)

    Use layering to organize the interface and guide merchant focus. Higher layers should be used for more important or interactive elements.

  </Small>

  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A series of cards with distinct shadows.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-9@2x.png)

    Use too many layers in one screen, as it can confuse merchants and make the interface difficult to navigate.

  </Small>

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Large variant="do">
    ![A card with tasks, where the task in view features a gray background.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-10@2x.png)

    Keep most elements on the same layer to establish a visual baseline, and allow for purposeful use of layering, when necessary, to denote importance or interactivity.

  </Large>

{' '}

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Large variant="dont">
    ![A card with tasks, where the task in view features a drop shadow and a bevel effect.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-11@2x.png)

    Resort to layering as the initial tool for emphasis. Explore other visual techniques first to highlight elements without disrupting the layering system.

    ## Surface depth

    Surfaces can enhance depth perception in an interface by establishing hierarchy and guiding attention.

    Distinct separation between surfaces, depending on the visual boundary, can suggest an indentation or elevation, further intensifying the sense of depth and [spatial organization](/design/layout/spacial-organization).

  </Text>

  <Large variant="do">
    ![The bottom of the search results card, featuring a grey background that contains secondary information.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-14@2x.png)

    Use a gray background to de-emphasize contained information. This will divert merchants’ attention towards more important information, as the muted background visually recedes, pushing the contained content into the background.

  </Large>

{' '}

<Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>

  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A table with products, featuring a yellow background for the first brown, and yellow outline for the main container.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-16@2x.png)

    Use bright or contrasting colors for container backgrounds or borders. This distracts merchants from the main content and creates a cluttered UI. More guidance can be found under [Color](/design/colors).

  </Small>

  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A card with a footer with a gray background and a distinct bevel effect between the main content and the footer.](/images/design/depth/creating/depth-creating-17@2x.png)

    Use unique styles for surfaces, like inset shadows. This makes the interface noisy and creates confusing information hierarchy.
