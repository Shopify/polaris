      ## Grid and keylines

      The icon grid and keylines ensure consistent sizing of icons in the Shopify admin.

    </Text>

  </ExtraLarge>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A 20 pixels square grid with an icon in a 16 px square.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-layout-1@2x.png)

    The icon container is 20 &times; 20 px. The content of an icon should be
    confined within a safe space of 16 &times; 16 px.

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A 20 pixels square grid with an icon in a 16 pixels square, with an element sticking out slightly.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-layout-2@2x.png)

   No part of an icon can go beyond the 16 &times; 16 px safe space as it will get clipped when resized for mobile experiences.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![Four icons that fit inside the following grids: 13x13 pixels square, 14x14 pixels circle, 14x12 pixels rectangles, horizontal and vertical.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-keylines-1@2x.png)

    The overall shape of an icon can vary from a circle to a square, or from a tall rectangle to a wide one. Always start with the following keylines, so that all icons have the same visual weight.

    These guidelines are a starting point, not a hard constraint. If it makes the concept stronger or keeps the icon optically aligned, it’s ok to deviate.

      ## Design guidelines

      Consistent use of stroke widths, style and metaphor is necessary for icons to feel streamlined in the admin.

    </Text>

  </ExtraLarge>

  <Medium variant="do">

    ![An archive box and a building represented in two dimensions. ](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-rules-1@2x.png)

    Ensure that icons are two-dimensional, and objects face forward.

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="dont">

    ![An archive box and a building represented with a perspective. ](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-rules-2@2x.png)

    Use perspective and 3D objects

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="caution">

    ![A package and a globe represented with slight hints of a third dimension.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-rules-3@2x.png)

    Subtle hints of a third dimension are acceptable when necessary for
    conceptual clarity.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="do">
    ![A presentation board icon centered in a 20 pixel square.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-rules-4@2x.png)

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="dont">

    ![Three icons made with organic shapes and small details representing a pin, a bell and a christmas tree.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-rules-6@2x.png)

    Use excessive details or organic shapes.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="do">

    ![A shopping cart with solid speed lines behind. ](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-rules-7@2x.png)

    Use a consistent visual style, stroke weight and only one color.

    ## Filled vs Outlined

    The default style of icons used throughout the admin is outlined. Usage of filled icons is strictly reserved for the main admin navigation and specific, semi-permanent states.

    different icons like a person, a tag, or an inbox, to differentiate the types
    of results.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-vs-outline-1@2x.png)

  <Small variant="do">
    ![A settings navigation menu with icons differentiating each item in the menu. All icons are filled expect for the one selected that is outlined.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-vs-outline-2@2x.png)

    Only use filled icons in the main navigation.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="do">
    ![A filled icons with a pin.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-vs-outline-3@2x.png)

    Use filled icons for semi-permanent selected states, like pinning an app.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    ![A filled icon within a blue badge.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-vs-outline-4@2x.png)

    Use filled icons to create emphasis.

      ### Designing outlined icons

    </Text>

  </ExtraLarge>
  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![An inbox icon where the outline stroke is highlighted.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-1@2x.png)

    Stroke weight is 1.5px

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![An inbox icon where the alignment with the pixel grid is highlighted. ](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-2@2x.png)

    Since the stroke has half a pixel, one side of the stroke should always be aligned with the pixel grid.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A clock icon highlighting the alignment with 0.25 pixels increments.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-3@2x.png)

    Exceptions are allowed for optical adjustments, as long as they fall on 0.25 px increments.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A Shopping card icons with the stroke terminals highlighted.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-4@2x.png)

    Terminals are round, even when a shape cuts out into another.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A calendar, an inbox and a shop icon with the corner radius highlighted. 3 pixels for the calendar, 2 pixels for the inbox and 1 pixel for the inbox.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-5@2x.png)

    Corner radius can go from 1 px to 3 px, depending on the object roundness. Joints and terminals must be rounded. Sharp corners are not allowed, except for intersections and cutouts.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![Six outline icons with small filled object highlighted, like a credit card that is made out of outlines and an icon that is filled.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-6@2x.png)

    Filled shapes can be used, only in really small objects, like in the dot of an exclamation point.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![An icons with a hand pressing a button, where the gaps between the button and the hand. ](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-outline-7@2x.png)

    The minimum gap between strokes should never be less than 1px.

      ### Designing filled icons

    </Text>

  </ExtraLarge>
  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A filled icon overlapping an outlined icon.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-1@2x.png)

    Filled icons should align closely to their outline pairs. They don’t need to be a pixel perfect match, but they must have a similar visual weight, and the transition from one to the other must feel smooth.

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A tag, a person and a flower icons made of simple shapes.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-2@2x.png)

    Icons are made out of contiguous shapes. Ideally one, but it’s possible to go up to three when required for clarity.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![Two icons with the stroke weight being highlighted.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-3@2x.png)


    Stroke weight is 1.5 px, but is reduced to 1.25 px when used inside a shape as a cut-out. Shapes must align with the pixel grid.

    Exceptions are allowed for optical adjustments, as long as they fall on 0.25 px increments.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![A shopping cart icon with the stroke terminals being highlighted, and a wallet icon with cutouts and intersection angles highlighted.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-4@2x.png)

    Terminals are round.

    Corner radius can vary from 1 px to 3 px, depending on the object's roundness. Terminals and joints are rounded. Sharp corners are not allowed, except in intersections and knockouts.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![Two arrow icons with the stroke being highlighted.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-5@2x.png)

    If it’s not possible to fill the outline icon, a 2px stroke can be used as a filled version.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="directive">

    ![An icon with a person and a key, where the gap between the two elements is highlighted.](/images/design/icons/icons-creating-filled-6@2x.png)

    The minimum gap between strokes should never be less than 1px.
