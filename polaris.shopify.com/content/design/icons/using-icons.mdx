      ## Replacing standard actions

      Common actions like edit, delete, and search have established icons that are universally understood. Leveraging pre-existing knowledge will improve clarity and help reduce clutter, since these icons require no text label.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="do">
      ![A card with customer information, with a pencil icon representing the edit action, and a clipboard icon representing the copy to clipboard action. ](/images/design/icons/icons-using-2@2x.png)

      Use icons to replace text for common actions with universally understood icons.
    </Column>
    <Column variant="dont">
      ![ A series of abstract icon buttons with no labels.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-3@2x.png)

      Use ambiguous icons without a text label, as that can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.

        ![An inbox icon representing orders in the navigation menu, in the search results and in an information card.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-4@2x.png)

        Use icons consistently once a meaning is assigned to them.

    <Column variant="do">
        ![An inbox icon next to a number, representing an order number.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-5@2x.png)
