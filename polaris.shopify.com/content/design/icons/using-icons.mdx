    ## Streamlining

    Icons serve a critical role in streamlining content and
    facilitating navigation. They represent actions or information visually,
    aiding in quick comprehension and efficient interaction.

    ## Common actions

    Common actions like edit, delete, and search have established icons that are universally understood. Leveraging pre-existing knowledge will improve clarity and help reduce clutter, since these icons require no text label.

  </Text>
  <Small variant="do">
    ![A card with customer information, with a pencil icon representing the edit action, and a clipboard icon representing the copy to clipboard action. ](/images/design/icons/icons-using-2@2x.png)

    Use icons to replace text for common actions with universally understood icons.

  </Small>

  <Small variant="dont">
    ![ A series of abstract icon buttons with no labels.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-3@2x.png)

    Use ambiguous icons without a text label, as that can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.

    ## Common objects

    Consistently pairing specific icons with objects enables users to quickly recognize them, which promotes a more efficient and intuitive interaction with the interface.

  </Text>
  <Small variant="do">
    ![An inbox icon representing orders in the navigation menu, in the search results and in an information card.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-4@2x.png)

    Use icons consistently once a meaning is assigned to them.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="do">
    ![An inbox icon next to a number, representing an order number.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-5@2x.png)

    Use icons to identify common objects, and to improve the overall clarity of the interface.

  </Small>
  <Small>{/* Empty space */}</Small>
  <Large variant="dont">
    ![A series of inbox icons in a table with all the orders.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-6@2x.png)

    Overuse icons. Redundant icons lead to visual clutter and increased cognitive load.

    ## Icon sizing

    Icon size and weight was specifically crafted to pair with typography.

  </Text>
  <Small variant="do">
    ![An icon next to text, highlighting the vertical alignment between the two elements.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-7@2x.png)

    Align icons vertically with accompanying typography.

  </Small>
  <Small variant="dont">
    ![Three oversized icons next to text.](/images/design/icons/icons-using-8@2x.png)

    Resize icons. Resizing them will distort the relationship that was established with typography.
