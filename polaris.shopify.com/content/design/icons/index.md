## Clear

Icons are simple and effectively convey their intended meaning. Avoid unnecessary complexity that makes the icon difficult to recognize. The goal is to communicate quickly and clearly.

<InlineGrid gap='4' columns={{xs: '1', md: '2'}}>

  <Do>
    ![Two icons made with basic geometric shapes representing an house and a flower.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-clear-1@2x.png)

    Draw simple objects that are easy to identify.

  </Do>

  <Dont>

    ![Two detailed icons representing an house and a flower.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-clear-2@2x.png)

    Embellish the icon with unnecessary details.

  </Dont>
</InlineGrid>

     ## Consistent
     Icons follow a cohesive visual style across the user interface. This includes a consistent use of line weights, shapes, dimensions, perspectives, and general style. Design consistency enables users to quickly recognize functionality and navigate the interface more intuitively.



      <InlineGrid gap='4' columns={{xs: '1', lg: '3'}}>

        <Do>

        ![On top: a series of icons using the same check mark element. At the bottom: a series of icons using a credit card represented consistently.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-consistent-1@2x.png)

        Reuse parts of other icons in the set to maintain visual harmony across all icons.

        </Do>

        <Do>

          ![A microphone and a pencil represented in a way that is consistent with common interfaces.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-consistent-2@2x.png)

          Use universally recognized icons.


        </Do>

        <Dont>

          ![A microphone and a pencil represented in a unique way.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-consistent-3@2x.png)

          Reinvent the way an object is represented.

        </Dont>


      </InlineGrid>


    ## Universal

Universally recognized symbols and metaphors ensure icons are easily understood by a broad user base.

<InlineGrid gap='4' columns={{xs: '1', md: '2'}}>
  <Do>
    ![Left: an icon composed with a shopping cart and an x sign. Right: an icon composed with a person and a plus sign.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-universal-1@2x.png)

Leverage universally recognized symbols and metaphors to create new icons.

  </Do>

  <Dont>
    ![An icon with a 2 euro coin representing the concept of “Money”; an icon with an american football representing the concept of “Sports”; and a floppy disk representing the concept of “Save”.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-universal-2@2x.png)

Rely on cultural-specific, niche symbols or outdated metaphors may not be understood by all users.

  </Dont>
