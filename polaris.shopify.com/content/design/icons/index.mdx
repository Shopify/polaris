    ## Clear

    Icons are simple and effectively convey their intended meaning. Avoid unnecessary complexity that makes the icon difficult to recognize. The goal is to communicate quickly and clearly.

    ## Consistent

    Icons follow a cohesive visual style across the user interface. This includes a consistent use of line weights, shapes, dimensions, perspectives, and general style. Consistency in designs enables users to quickly recognize functionality and navigate the interface more intuitively.

    ## Universal

    Universally recognized symbols and metaphors ensure icons are easily understood by a broad user base.

  </Text>

      ![Left: an icon composed with a shopping cart and an x sign. Right: an icon composed with a person and a plus sign.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-universal-1@2x.png)

      Leverage universally recognized symbols and metaphors to create new icons.

      ![An icon with a 2 euro coin representing the concept of “Money”; an icon with an american football representing the concept of “Sports”; and a floppy disk representing the concept of “Save”.](/images/design/icons/icons-overview-universal-2@2x.png)

      Relying on cultural-specific, niche, or outdated metaphors may not be suitable for all users.
