      ## Typography defines hierarchy

      Typography plays a crucial role in defining hierarchy within design. Variable weights convey different levels of importance, where bolder weights indicate greater significance.

      Good type positioning also establishes visual prominence and emphasizes key information.

      ## Typography defines purpose

      Polaris assigns meaning to type based on its usage. Mono is used for code; tabular number stylesets are employed for numbers and currency amounts; and typescales are designed with UI design in mind.
