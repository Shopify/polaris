      ## Font

      The Shopify admin utilizes the Inter font, an open-source variable font that offers adjustable knobs for fine-tuning font weight and slant.

      For languages where Inter doesn’t offer a complete set of glyphs, the admin employs the system font to ensure proper rendering and compatibility.

      ## Typescale

      Polaris offers two typescales: heading and body. These typescales are used to create visual pairings in the UI and all line heights are aligned with the 4px grid.

      The typescale in the admin is tailored for UI usage as the primary focus. Designed with software in mind first and foremost, it’s optimized for use in high density layouts with intricate details and complex features.

      Learn more about applying type in the [using type section](/design/typography/using-type).
