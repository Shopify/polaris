          ## Pro feel

          **Interactions are highly functional, responsive, and
          effective.**

          The Shopify admin is a piece of software, not a website. Interfaces are easy to understand and navigate, and common actions are offered in their simplest form and are easy to access and consistently positioned.

        <Box padding="400">

          Every visual in the admin plays a role in helping merchants scan information and perform tasks without unnecessary distractions.

          Interactions are quick and user actions provide instant feedback that feels almost life-like. Transitions are seamless and help create an intuitive navigation experience.

          ## Meaningful

          **Visual language is clear for merchants.**

          When using color, strong meaning is associated. Red means danger, green means go. Color roles are heightened in the interface and add a layer of detail that merchants can quickly understand and master.

          Leveraging established symbols to identify key functionality helps merchants understand the admin at first glance. Using clear icons that are widely recognized creates a clear and predictable experience.

          ## High density

          **Space is optimized while maintaining high usability.**

          Density in the interface adapts to the task: high density is used in data-rich environments, while low density is employed in focused, detailed areas.

          Information is structured in a clear visual hierarchy, emphasizing important details through variants like size, weight, and color.

        <Box padding="400">

          Space is used to create groups of related information. Color adds or removes emphasis to make the interface easier to scan and enables efficient decision making.

          ## Tactility

          **Interfaces incorporate a sense of realness.**

          Primary interaction points provide a dramatic visual response to interaction. Variables like position and lighting change to mimic how physical buttons react when pressed. A hover transition is smooth and unobtrusive, whilst feedback from a click feels more dramatic and visceral.

        </Box>
      </Grid.Cell>

      <Grid.Cell columnSpan={{xs: 6, sm: 6, md: 6, lg: 4, xl: 4}}>
        <Box padding="400">

          Detailed interactions, such as animating a checkbox when it is ticked, create a sense of familiarity and reference how merchants interact with real-world objects. These animations contribute to making the admin interface feel dynamic and alive, whilst making merchants feel more comfortable and confident in their interactions.

          ## Commonality

          **Objects with similar appearance share a common behavior.**

          Elements that are similar visually behave consistently throughout the interface. Consistency in behavior reduces confusion and cognitive load for merchants.

          By using consistent signifiers throughout the user experience, merchants can effectively apply the concepts they learn as they navigate the admin. This enables a smoother learning curve and makes the interface progressively easier to use.
