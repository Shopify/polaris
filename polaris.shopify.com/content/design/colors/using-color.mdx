    ## Color relationships

    While color roles define the value of each concept of UI it styles, color relationships between each one of these concepts define how color is used in the Shopify admin.

    ### Background

    Background colors are used as the baseline of all UI in the admin. The admin itself has a background, and some components can also have a background if they are not built within a [surface](/design/layout/spacial-organization#surfaces).

    Background colors can only have other elements of any other color except for other background colors above them. Multiple background colors can exist in the same viewport only if they exist side by side.

      ### Surface

      Surface colors are the most versatile in the color system. Surface is the background color for elements with the highest level of prominence, like a card or a banner. Many elements can sit on top of a surface to create complex components and patterns.

      Surface colors also come with various hierarchical levels and can be used to increase or decrease emphasis on specific areas of the UI.

      ### Fill

      Fill is the background color for an element with a smaller surface area like a button or a badge. Fills are usually the most vibrant color in an interface. They sit on backgrounds and surfaces and sometimes sit on top of other fills.

      Fills also come with their explicit text and icon colors, called `on-fill`.

    ![A card with an info badge using fill colors that offers an incentive](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-fill-do@2x.png)

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="dont">
    ![A card using only fill colors instead of normal surface and text colors](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-fill-dont@2x.png)

    ![A badge that uses a fill color as background but with a normal text color for its type, making it hard to read](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-fill-onfill-dont@2x.png)

    Mix fills with text colors that are not “on-fill”. These combinations might not pass minimum contrast ratio requirements.

      ### Border

      Borders are used primarily in data tables to enhance visual structure and organization or large amounts of information. They visually separate and contain elements, and can be used to either delineate rows or define the space of a [nested table](/design/layout/spacial-organization#nesting-tables).

  </Text>

  <Medium variant="do">
    ![An index table](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-border-do@2x.png)

    Use borders for tables, and divided surfaces that look like tables, to make data easier to read.

  <Medium variant="do">

    Use borders to delineate information. Check out [Dividing surfaces](/design/layout/spacial-organization#dividing-surfaces) for guidance.

      ### Text

      Text color can be used on any text element and any icon element that accompanies text. Text colors are designed to be fully accessible, in terms of contrast on their corresponding backgrounds and surfaces, and should only be used in tandem with them, but can generally be used on any other background or surface if contrast is sufficient.

      Text color that exists on a fill has its own `on-fill` color. This relationship is strict and `on-fill` text can only be used on its corresponding `fill` color.

  <Medium variant="do">
    ![A type composition with a headline, followed by a slightly lighter subtitle and even slightly lighter text](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-text-do@2x.png)

    Use text color to create visual hierarchy by using default, secondary, or tertiary role colors when available.

  <Medium variant="dont">
    ![A card with a surface background, but with text using an on-fill color](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-text-dont@2x.png)

    Use text `on-fill` colors on anything else but its corresponding `fill` color. These combinations might not pass minimum contrast ratio requirements.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="dont">
    ![A piece of text that says “error”, styled with the critical fill color](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-text-other-dont@2x.png)

    Use any other color except for text colors for any text that is part of the UI.

      ### Link

      Link color is used exclusively for text links that appear in lines and paragraphs of text. Link color follows the same logic as Text color: it can only be used with its corresponding background or surface colors in the same color role, but can generally be used on any other background or surface if contrast is sufficient.

  </Text>

  </Medium>
  <Medium variant="do">
    ![An “Add favorite product” button with a link color](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-link-dont@2x.png)

    Use link color to style text buttons. Use the appropriate [color role](/design/colors/palettes-and-roles#color-roles) and component instead.

  </Medium>

  </LayoutSection>

  <Text>
      ### Icon

      Icon colors are used exclusively for standalone icons. These colors are tailored to meet color contrast ratios for interactive elements that do not include text. Icon colors should only be used on their corresponding background and surface colors, but can generally be used on any other background or surface if contrast is sufficient.

  </Text>

    Use icon colors to style an icon that is standalone.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="dont">
    ![A “unfulfilled” badge with text label, all styled with the icon color](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-icon-dont@2x.png)

    Use icon colors to style text, as the color contrast might not be enough. Instead, style the entire icon and text composition using the text color.

      ## Combining color roles

      Elements with different [color roles](/design/colors/palettes-and-roles#color-roles) can coexist alongside each other, enhancing merchants' comprehension of complex patterns when appropriately utilized in component combinations.

      In some cases, the superposition of elements with different color roles is necessary, like using a critical icon button on a default card. These combinations may require additional testing to check for proper color contrast.

  </Text>

  <Medium variant="do">
    ![Detail shot of different badges used in an order card](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-combining-do@2x.png)

    Meaningful combinations of color roles can enhance a merchant’s experience.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="dont">
      ![Tabs in an index table with different badges of different colors being used in each tab label](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-combining-dont@2x.png)

      Avoid creating color role combinations that look too jarring or that create visual competition between elements.

      ## Disabled color scheme

      Some elements may require a disabled state. The color scheme for disabled elements is intentionally consistent throughout the admin interface, generally avoiding the use of distinct colors for each color role.

  </Text>

  <Large columnSpan={{xs: 6, sm: 6, md: 6, lg: 8, xl: 8}}>

    ![A collection of components in disabled states](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-disabled@2x.png)

  <Medium variant="do">
    ![Detail shot of disabled elements in a form](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-disabled-do@2x.png)

    Use the disabled color scheme for disabled elements.

  </Medium>

  <Medium variant="dont">
      ![Semi-transparent elements in a form that blend in](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-disabled-dont@2x.png)

      Use opacity or any other means to communicate disabled states.

  </Medium>

      ## Using other colors

      The creation of new color roles is tied to the Shopify admin. Some colors available in the color palette are not yet tied to a color role. Usage of these colors is strictly reserved for illustration work.

      More information about what color roles are available and their respective purposes can be found in color roles.

  </Text>
  <Large variant="do">

    ![Other colors that are not attached to a color role used in an illustration](/images/design/colors/color-using-color-other-colors@2x.png)

    In the case of illustrations, any color of the color palette can be used. Diagrams, however, need to respect color role usage if they represent an abstracted view of the admin.
