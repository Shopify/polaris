    ## Color tokens

    Tokens are a method of applying color in a consistent and meaningful way across the admin. They provide a layer of abstraction from the hex values themselves, making it easy to implement large scale changes across the admin.

    See the [token](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/color) section for the full list of color tokens and their descriptions.

    ### Semantic tokens

    Semantic tokens help communicate the intent of a given color and create predictable behavior across our tokens. They start with declaring the token group color, followed by the element it's applied to, such as a bg, border, text, or icon.

    Following the element, semantic tokens may have one or more modifiers to further represent color application: color role, prominence, and state.

<Text>
    **Element:** The UI element being styled: `bg`, `bg-surface`, `bg-fill`, `text`, `border`, and `icon`.

    **Role:** Assigns roles to specific colors for consistent application.

    **Prominence:** Communicates what the token is used for.

    **State:** Communicates the state of a UI element.

        ### Specialty tokens

        Some concepts have their own specific color tokens, known as specialty tokens. Specialty tokens start with declaring the concept and any associated variants, followed by the semantic token structure. These tokens should never be used for anything other than the concept they’re referencing.

      ## Interaction states

      Interaction states are communicated by adding `-hover`, `-active`, `-selected`, or `-disabled` to the end of the semantic token. For example, the state token for `-color-bg-surface` is `-color-bg-surface-hover`.

      ### Hover

      Hover state tokens provide visual feedback to merchants when they hover their cursor over an interactive element, like a button or link.

      ### Active

      Active state tokens communicate when an interactive element is pressed (by a cursor or finger).

  <Text>

      ### Focus

      Focus states are triggered by the merchant and highlight elements when using a keyboard to navigate the UI.

      Focus states usually take on the element’s hover state and add a blue outline using the `border-focus` token.

      ### Selected

      Selected state tokens communicate an item or option has been chosen. They can be applied to elements like buttons, tabs, checkboxes, radio buttons, or navigation items.

  <Text>
      ### Disabled

      Disabled state tokens indicate when the user isn’t allowed to interact with an element. They remove all interactivity from a component.

      Disabled elements don’t need to meet WC3 contrast standards and are intentionally de-emphasized to clearly communicate their state.
