    ## Color has purpose

    The purpose of using color has to be clear. Color needs to support a message or status that needs to be easily identifiable by merchants.

  <Text>

    Each usage of color within the Shopify admin is purposefully tied to a [specific meaning](/design/colors/palettes-and-roles#color-roles). For instance, red signifies critical errors, green represents success messages, and blue is used to draw attention to tips and offers. Using color as decoration is exclusive to illustration.

    This deliberate color coding facilitates merchants in identifying which parts of the user interface require focus and distinguishes them from the default features provided by the Shopify admin.

    ## Color has impact

    The Shopify admin interface adopts a black and white color scheme, intentionally creating a neutral backdrop. By employing this monochromatic design, elements that incorporate color gain heightened visual impact and prominence.

  <Text>

    The intentional design of the overall interface in black and white enables strategically positioned and carefully selected elements to grab merchants' attention. By utilizing color purposefully, the focus is directed towards crucial information, actions, and visual cues.

    Create impact when using color by using appropriate shades to convey the importance of what is being communicated to merchants.

    ## Color is accessible

    Polaris offers consistent color palettes for each color role. This means that each color is assigned a specific relationship within the overall palette.

    These [color relationships](/design/colors/using-color#combining-color-roles) ensure that color contrasts remain consistent across every application of color and ensure proper legibility and understanding when it comes to combining texts with color and interactive shapes with various backgrounds.

  <Text>

      Colors are meant to be easily understood and read by all merchants. Sufficient contrast makes things easier to find, identify, and interact with.
