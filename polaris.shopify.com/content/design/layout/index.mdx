    ## Space defines proximity

    Space plays a vital role in establishing connections between items. The principle of proximity states that the closer objects are, the stronger their perceived relationship.

    ## Emphasis creates hierarchy

    In the Shopify admin, larger, heavier, and contrasting elements attract attention and create visual rhythm.

    Smaller, lighter, and more subtle elements are work-oriented and provide detailed information.

  Use size, weight, and contrast to establish hierarchy in the admin. Divider
  lines are used to delimit rows of information in data and index tables, and
  rarely for dividing information elsewhere.

    ## Software, not website

    Since the admin is more like software, rather than a website, elements need to be sized appropriately based on their job.

  <Text>
    Compact elements add detail, and larger elements command more attention.
    Surfaces adapt to these components and offer an optimized view of the admin.

  <Small variant="do">

    Create compact components for specialized, minute tasks.
