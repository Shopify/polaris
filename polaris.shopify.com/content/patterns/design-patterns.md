A design pattern is a repeatable solution to a common UX problem in a specific merchant situation. Using the right pattern in the right context makes the Shopify admin familiar and easy to use.

## Principles

For patterns to be successful, they need to be consistent, unified, and contextual.

### Consistent

Patterns are always used in the same way for the same reasons. Merchants need to be able to trust their expectations.

### Unified

Patterns are always informed by and designed together with similar patterns. For example, patterns with similar purpose should complement each other, and patterns with similar functionality should share appearance and behavior.

### Contextual

A pattern is always paired with the problem it solves and the situation it appears in. A solution applied in a context it wasnâ€™t designed for is not a pattern.
