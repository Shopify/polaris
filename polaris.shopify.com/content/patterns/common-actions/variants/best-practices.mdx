    ## Content

    Actions should always clearly communicate their purpose by using a text label, an icon, or a combination of both.
    
    See the [actionable language guidelines](/content/actionable-language#buttons) for more detail.

    ![An image showing icons used for common actions add, edit, delete, remove, copy.](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-best-practices-icons@2x.png)

    Use icons in place of text for common actions. Leveraging pre-existing knowledge will improve clarity and help reduce clutter, since these icons require no text label.

    ## Visual hierarchy

      Style and placement help visually communicate the importance of an action on the page.

  </Text>

  <Large variant="do">

    ![An image showing secondary and tertiary buttons in a card and a list.](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-visual-hierarchy-secondary-tertiary@2x.png)

    Use secondary or tertiary buttons to give actions less emphasis while making them accessible for as many users as possible.

  </Large>

  <Text>

    Actions in editors need an additional level of emphasis to attract merchant attention and establish hierarchy between elements.

  <Large variant="do">

    ## Interactivity

      Elements that are visually similar behave consistently throughout the interface. Consistency in behavior reduces confusion and cognitive load for merchants.

    ### Desktop

    Actions on desktop and mobile should consider both cursor and touch interactions, but the primary interaction for the desktop is cursor-based. Take advantage of added real-estate and interactions by using progressive disclosure to expose actions in context when the merchant needs them.
