    ### Icons and labels

    Actions should always clearly communicate their purpose by using a text label, an icon, or a combination of both.

    </Stack>

  </Text>

  <Large variant="do">

    ![An image showing icons used for common actions add, edit, delete, remove, copy.](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-best-practices-icons@2x.png)

    Use icons in place of text for common actions. Leveraging pre-existing knowledge will improve clarity and help reduce clutter, since these icons require no text label.

    ![An image showing a list with a long label: "Add options like size and color.](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-best-practices-long-labels@2x.png)

    Use the appropriate icon to reinforce the message when referring to a specialized or complex action.

    ![An image showing text labels following the verb noun formatting and highlighting what the object type is for each; "Add customer", "Edit address", "Delete products", "Copy email".](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-best-practices-label-reflect-object@2x.png)

    ### Visual hierarchy

      Style and placement help visually communicate the importance of an action on the page.

    </Stack>

  </Text>

  <Large variant="do">

    ![An image showing secondary and tertiary buttons in a card and a list.](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-visual-hierarchy-secondary-tertiary@2x.png)

    Use secondary or tertiary buttons to give actions less emphasis while making them accessible for as many users as possible.

  </Large>

  <Text>

    Actions in editors need an additional level of emphasis to attract merchant attention and establish hierarchy between elements.

  </Medium>

    ![An image showing a card with ten different actions using the secondary button style.](/images/patterns/common-actions/common-actions-visual-hierarchy-limit-contained-buttons@2x.png)

    ### Interactivity

      Elements that are visually similar behave consistently throughout the interface. Consistency in behavior reduces confusion and cognitive load for merchants.
