    ### Visual hierarchy

    Style and placement help visually communicate the importance of an add action on the page.

    Buttons that have a fill or background shape tend to be the most visually prominent, and can help merchants find the action they’re most likely to want.

    #### Icons

    **Icons add visual prominence to an action without relying on color.**

    </Stack>

    <Stack gap="400">

    The [circle plus icon](link) holds more visual weight and draws the merchants attention. This icon is used in buttons that don’t have a defined shape or fill.

    The plus icon holds less weight on its own. It’s used in buttons that have a visible shaped container to support the action while balancing the weight of the element with the rest of the UI.
