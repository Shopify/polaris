    ## Anatomy

    **Cards are made up of three main parts: the header, the body, and the footer. Each part has a specific role and should contain content that serves that role.**

    A standardized structure ensures that common elements can be placed consistently. Consistent placement allows merchants to attach meaning to places, shape expectations, and quickly find what they are looking for.

      ## Header

      The header represents the whole card. It typically has a **card title** that makes the card easy to find, and often a **header action** that allows merchants to modify the card contents or navigate to where they can view more details.

    ### Card titles

    The card title represents the whole card. It should describe the purpose of the card and help merchants quickly find it among other cards.

    ### Header actions

    Actions in the header should represent the content of the whole card. The most common header action is the "Edit" action, which allows merchants to modify the contents of the card. Another common action is the "View" action, which allows merchants to navigate to the source of the contents.

    Avoid placing [list actions](#list-actions) in the card header by default. Default to placing such actions at the end of the list where the added item will appear. If cards only contain a list, then list actions may be placed in the header for merchant convenience.

    ### Table actions

    Table actions are placed to the right in the header to keep them discoverable. They are typically actions that allow merchants to add item or select items that will display in the table.

      The body holds the main content of a card. Common content types, such as lists, tables, and form layouts, are organized into one or multiple **card sections**.

  </ExtraLarge>

  <Text>
    ### Card sections

    Card sections are used to group content in cards, and to separate such groups when there are more than one. A section typically has a heading and a main block of content, such as a list or a form layout.

    ### Form layouts

    Form layouts are containers that give structure to form elements, or “form layout items”. They often contain multiple items, but can also house a single one.

      ## Footer

      The footer is placed after the main content, which makes it an intuitive place for content and actions that extends from the card content. For example, call-to-actions that allow merchants to react to the card and continue with their next task.
    </Text>

  </ExtraLarge>

  <Text>
    ### Call-to-actions

    Call-to-actions are specific prompts designed to guide merchants towards a goal. They are placed towards the right to inspire progress. A card can have none, one, or multiple call-to-actions. They are placed in the footer, so that merchants can react to the card contents and easily take the next step forward.

    List actions are placed to the left in the footer. They are typically actions that allow merchants to add items to lists or expand and collapse the list.

    ## Spacing for merchants

    When composing card content, spacing is used to achieve two important visual effects: grouping and hierarchy. When merchants can perceive clear grouping and hierarchy, it’s easier for them to scan a lot of content and faster find what they need.

    In the admin, spacing is mainly achieved using padding and stacks.

    ## Padding

    Padding is the space between a container’s content and its border. The default card padding is space-400.

</Large>

  <Text>
    ### Nested padding

    It’s common that cards have containers nested inside them. When these containers have visual boundaries, such as with borders or dividers, then padding is used to create space between its content and border.

    The general rule is that the deeper an element is nested, the smaller its padding is.

  </Text>

  <Text>
    ## Stacks and gaps

    Stacks are used to group content and give equal spacing between the elements within the group. The space between the elements is called the gap, and is always the same between each element.

    ![A simple schematic showing a stack with gaps.](/images/patterns/card-layout/spacing/card-layout-spacing-08-stacks-and-gaps@2x.png)

  </Large>

  <Text>
    ### Nested stacks

    Stacks can also be nested to apply different gaps between different groups of content. It’s the difference between the gap sizes that creates the effect of grouping and hierarchy. Elements with tighter gaps are perceived as more related than those with a looser gap.

  </Text>

  <Large>

    Use a flat hierarchy that causes section titles to float with equal space to sections above and below.

    ### Common stacks

    There are a few common stacks that can be used to meet recurring spacing needs. These stacks have gaps that range from space-100 to space-400, and they are purposefully used to create a familiar hierarchy of groups in cards across the admin.

  <Text>
    **Space-300** gaps are typically used to ensure clear separation between blocks containing closely related but irregularly shaped content, such as form layout items.

    While space-200 gaps might seem logical around stacks with space-100 gaps, a smaller gap size often obscures groupings when block boundaries are hard to discern. This is particularly true for form layout items, where labels, inputs, and help text all exhibit variable size, shape, and weight. By increasing the gap size, content blocks can be more readily perceived as unified, discrete items.

    ## Alignment

    Content alignment makes cards more balanced and easier for merchants to scan. Content should be vertically aligned along both the left and right edge of the card. It’s always more important to align content [optically](#optically), so that it appears to be aligned rather than technically being aligned.
