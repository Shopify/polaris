1. The page header provides easy access to actions and navigation. It spans the full width of the page to show merchants that these actions represent the page as a whole.
2. The main content is split in two columns, primary content to the left and secondary content to the right. The primary content occupies two thirds of the page to give more space to what’s most important most of the time.
3. Content is placed in cards, and similar content is grouped in the same card. This helps merchant find and focus on specific subtasks.

### **Use when merchants need to**

**View and edit resource objects**
:   This pattern is typically paired with the [resource index layout](/patterns/resource-index-layout) pattern. Together they create one of the Shopify admin’s strongest patterns. Merchants start learning how to use it when they create their first product, and then continue to use it for other essential resource objects such as orders and customers. Use it when merchants need to manage any individual resource object, including niched ones such as discounts, shipping labels, and newsletters.

**Create resource objects**
:   Using the resource detail layout when merchants create new resources teaches them both what a resource page looks like and how edit one later.
