Following these 4 fundamentals will steer you right in 90% of all content design decisions.

## Content 🤝 design

Think of tools you use every day. Your phone, car, blender. They all have a learning curve. But the very best of them feel easy from the very first use. Buttons are where you expect them. Labeling is intuitive. You know what to do next. Everything unnecessary has been sanded away, and what’s left is the perfect balance of words and visuals. That’s what we’re building here at Shopify.

- Let visuals and icons do the talking (“+” not “+ Add”)
- Nix the links (which make things feel less like worldclass software, more more like a webpage circa 2011)
- Design doesn’t always dictate content (not every situation calls for subcopy, even if the component has been designed to include it)

**Tip:** Ask yourself, could this word be an icon? Could this header, subcopy, and button just be a button?

## Keep content lean

Too much content makes a tool feel cheap and signals that it’s hard to use. Not enough leads to confusion and frustration. Great design means finding that sweet spot between the two extremes.

- Find the shortest, clearest way to give merchants only the info they need to take action
- Skip the punctuation (exceptions: questions or text with 2+ sentences)
- Blow away the repetition

**Tip:** Approach content like Jenga. What’s the most you can take away before things fall apart?


## Write like merchants talk

Don’t worry too much about voice and tone, just focus on sounding human

- Use plain language
- Use contractions (“don’t” not “do not”)
- Some jargon is okay, as long as it’s what actual merchants say
- Aim for a 7th grade reading level—it’s easiest for busy merchants to digest

**Tip:** Read it out loud. Does it sound like something a human would say? Ship it.

## Inspire action

Don’t overwhelm people with too many choices or too much info up front

- Focus on the one thing merchants need to know or do next
- Start sentences with verbs so they feel like actionable instructions
- Be direct (“add apps” not “you can add apps”)
- Use design (font size, location on the screen) to communicate importance
- Break multi-part tasks down into digestible steps (aka “progressive disclosure”)

**Tip:** What’s the most important thing for merchants to do here? If it’s not clear, start over.
