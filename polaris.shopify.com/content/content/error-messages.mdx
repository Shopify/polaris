Error messages should:

- Explain what’s wrong and what the merchant needs to do
- Be specific (exact numbers and dates, or even the merchant’s own data)
- Don’t overapologize or bring “us”/”we” into the conversation unless Shopify caused the problem
- Avoid error jargon like “invalid”
- Use detailed instructions for the next step
- Help merchants avoid mistakes in the first place, using clear content to manage expectations and highlight potential risks
- Only explain what happened behind the scenes when it’s helpful to merchants or you can’t offer a solution

As always, follow our content [fundamentals](/content/fundamentals) of keeping it short, using plain language, and getting rid of repetition.

## Design for clarity

- Use iconography and color to communicate the severity of the problem and draw the merchant’s attention to what’s wrong
- Place the error close to what needs fixed
- Use red for critical messages that merchants need to deal with immediately to avoid harm to their business
form validation errors
- Use yellow for errors that are part of a daily workflow or warnings that could lead to critical errors if not addressed

## Anatomy of an error message

- Explain how to fix it

#### CTA (optional)
