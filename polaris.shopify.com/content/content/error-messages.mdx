Error messages should:

- Explain what’s wrong and what the merchant needs to do
- Be specific (exact numbers and dates, or even the merchant’s own data)
- Don’t overapologize or bring “us”/”we” into the conversation unless Shopify caused the problem
- Avoid error jargon like “invalid”
- Use detailed instructions for the next step
- Help merchants avoid mistakes in the first place, using clear content to manage expectations and highlight potential risks
- Only explain what happened behind the scenes when it’s helpful to merchants or you can’t offer a solution

As always, follow all our content principles of keeping it short, using plain language, and getting rid of repetition. Also, good design can reduce the need for error messages by preventing them.

## Design for clarity

- Use iconography and color to communicate the severity of the problem and draw the merchant’s attention to what’s wrong
- Place the error close to what needs fixed
- Use red for critical messages that merchants need to deal with immediately to avoid harm to their business
form validation errors
- Use yellow for errors that are part of a daily workflow or warnings that could lead to critical errors if not addressed

## Anatomy of an error message

#### CTA (optional)
