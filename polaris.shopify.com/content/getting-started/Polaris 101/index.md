## What is Polaris?

Polaris is the design system for the Shopify admin. It’s the shared language that guides how we build high-quality merchant experiences, and is grounded in deep merchant understanding. The Polaris components are available for web, iOS, and Android. The design system is made up of design guidance, code libraries, development opinions, and API documentation on how to build merchant experiences for the Shopify admin. Learn more about the [foundational pieces](/what-are-patterns-components-tokens) that make up the Polaris design system.

### Who is Polaris for? 

Polaris is used both internally at Shopify and externally by third-party developers and designers. The Shopify admin includes installable apps built by Shopify employees and third-party developers. Third-party developers can use App Bridge and Polaris to build their Shopify admin apps. Shopify admin apps are web-based and are embedded into the admin web, iOS, and Android platforms.
