# Layout

Layout patterns provide common ways to arrange the content of a screen.

---

## Structure of a screen

A screen is the entire user interface (UI) of an application at a given time.

A typical Polaris screen consists of several layers. The app frame makes up the
outer layer. Within that are the page component and a layout component.

The layout component arranges containers like cards and banners in a way that’s
responsive across all screen sizes.

### App frame

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Screen from the Shopify admin, highlighting the top bar with logo, search and profile menu, and the navigation sidebar on the left](/public_images/layout-page/app-frame-diagram@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

The app frame is the outer UI of the application. It holds global features like
top-level navigation and search.

### Page component

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Screen highlighting the top of the page content and the side margins of the page](/public_images/layout-page/page-frame-diagram@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

The [page component](/components/structure/page):

- Acts as a container for the content of each specific page
- Controls the horizontal margins of the content area
- Has a header containing the breadcrumb, page title, and page-level actions

Page component variations:

- Full width. Use this for wide content like lists and tables.
- Single-column. Use this narrow variant to focus the page on a single
  transaction, like filling out a form.

### Layout component

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Admin screen highlighting a typical layout](/public_images/layout-page/page-layout-diagram@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

Within the page, the [layout component](/components/structure/layout) groups the
content into sections. Sections control how the content flows into columns. Each
section can be:

- Full-width
- Primary (2/3 width)
- Secondary (1/3 width)
- Annotated

### Arranging content in a layout

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Screen highlighting a layout with: page-level banner up top, primary and secondary sections in the middle, and footer actions below](/public_images/layout-page/cards-in-layout-diagram@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

Place page-level [banners](/components/feedback-indicators/banner) in a full-width section
at the top of the page.

Stack [cards](/components/structure/card) in sections to separate the screen’s
main content into meaningful groups.

For screens that represent an individual resource like a product or order, place
[page actions](/components/structure/page-actions) in a full-width section at
the bottom of the page.

For pages that don’t have footer actions, the
[footer help component](/components/navigation/footer-help) can offer a
link to documentation about the current screen.

### Layout in a card

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Diagram showing the anatomy of a card component, showing the card title and header actions at the top, two sections in the middle, and footer below](/public_images/layout-page/card-layout-diagram@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

[Cards](/components/structure/card) have a similar structure to the page as a
whole.

- Cards often have a header, with a title and card-level actions on the right.
- Cards can have footer actions.
- Complex cards can be split into sections. Card sections are automatically
  separated with a divider.
- Sections often have a subheader with a title on the left and section-level
  actions on the right.

For more details, including when to use header and footer actions, see the
[card component](/components/structure/card).

## Specialty screen types

The structure described above applies to most screens in the Shopify admin, but
other types of screens exist.

**Embedded Shopify apps**, including sales channels, are contained within the
normal app frame. However, they display the [page component](/components/structure/page) differently.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Typical embedded app settings screen, showing the embedded page header with app icon and breadcrumb.](/public_images/layout-page/embedded-page-diagram@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

**Sell screens** present opt-in features that require additional payment.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Shopify Capital sell screen. The standard app frame and page components contain a layout with a large illustration and introductory heading. This is followed by side-by-side cards with different offers, and a grid of selling points.](/public_images/layout-page/sell-screen@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

**Immersive editors** are for complex, interactive editing tasks. Immersive
editors often show a live preview of what’s being worked on with tools for
making changes arranged around the edges.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius Image--border">

![Shopify theme editor screen, with specialized top bar and side bar offering edit controls, and a preview of the online store website in the middle](/public_images/layout-page/theme-editor-screen@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

## Standard page layouts

The following patterns describe common ways to arrange content within the app
frame and below the page header.

### Single column, wide

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Generic customers list screen, showing how a wider layout can fit more content about each customer](/public_images/layout-page/page-frame-wide@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

Use this layout for wide list or table views that benefit from more horizontal
space.

- Set the page component to full width
- Use one or more basic layout sections

```jsx
<Page fullWidth title="Single column wide layout">
  <Layout>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Page-level banners */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Wide page content */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Page footer content */}</Layout.Section>
  </Layout>
</Page>
```

### Single column, narrow

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Example screen showing a complex form in a narrow layout](/public_images/layout-page/page-frame-narrow@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

Use this layout to focus merchant attention on a screen dedicated to a single
task, like filling out a form.

- Set the page component to single column (narrow) mode
- Use one or more basic layout sections

```jsx
<Page singleColumn title="Single column narrow layout">
  <Layout>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Page-level banners */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Narrow page content */}</Layout.Section>
  </Layout>
</Page>
```

### Primary/secondary

Primary/secondary layouts split content into a main column and a secondary one.
The main column is usually on the left, but can be on the right.

The most common use of the primary/secondary layout is for showing the details
for an individual object, such as an order or product.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Product details page, with cards for product title, description and images in the left, primary column, and cards for publishing to sales channels and product tags in the secondary column](/public_images/layout-page/page-layout-details@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

- Set the page component to its default width.
- Place the most important content in a primary column.
- Place other content in the secondary column. Content here should be
  navigational, less frequently used, or not essential.

```jsx
<Page title="Details page">
  <Layout>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Page-level banners */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Primary content */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section secondary>{/* Secondary content */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section>{/* Page actions (delete and save) */}</Layout.Section>
  </Layout>
</Page>
```

Another use of this layout is for a focused task where a summary is helpful,
such as purchasing shipping labels for an order.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![Create shipping labels screen, with configuration for the labels in the left, primary column, and summary with “Buy shipping labels” button in the secondary column](/public_images/layout-page/page-layout-task-with-summary@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

- Set the page component to its default width
- Place the primary column on the left to hold the main UI
- Place the secondary column on the right to hold the summary and call to action

```jsx
<Page title="Task screen with summary">
  <Layout>
    <Layout.Section>{/* UI to complete the task */}</Layout.Section>
    <Layout.Section secondary>
      {/* Summary and call to action */}
    </Layout.Section>
  </Layout>
</Page>
```

### Annotated

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image Image--radius">

![General settings page, with annotated sections for “Store details” and “Store address” visible](/public_images/layout-page/page-layout-annotated@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

Annotated layouts group the content of the page into distinct sections that are
only loosely related. This layout makes it easier to scan the page for a
particular section.

Use this layout for settings screens. Don’t use this layout when merchants
need to navigate to more than one section to complete their task.

- Set the page component to its default width.
- Use an annotated layout section for each independent topic on the page.
- Avoid combining annotated layouts with other layout types.

```jsx
<Page title="Annotated layout">
  <Layout>
    <Layout.AnnotatedSection
      title="Store details"
      description="Shopify and your customers will use this information to contact you."
    >
      {/* Details fields */}
    </Layout.AnnotatedSection>
    <Layout.AnnotatedSection
      title="Store address"
      description="This address will appear on your invoices."
    >
      {/* Address fields */}
    </Layout.AnnotatedSection>
  </Layout>
</Page>
```

### Custom page layouts

Most screens in the Shopify admin use one of these layouts, but they aren’t the
only ones you can use in Polaris. The following layouts are also possible:

- Multi-column list
- Grid of equals
- Masonry layout

To achieve these and other layouts, create one or more custom layout components.
Think of layout components a set of “shelves” into which other components can be
placed.

---

## Small-scale layout

The [stack](/components/structure/stack) component is useful for small-scale
layout. It lets you arrange arbitrary components in a horizontal row or vertical
stack. It’s also a useful component for applying
[standard spacing](/design/spacing).

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image">

![A text label, text value and badge arranged in a row with space between](/public_images/layout-page/stack-horizontal@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

Stacks work especially well for a row of components where one item needs to grow
to fill the available space. When space becomes constrained, the content will
wrap by default.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image">

![A custom heading on the left (labeled “fill”) and UI control pushed to the right (labeled “auto”)](/public_images/layout-page/stack-with-fill@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

### Custom small-scale layouts

You’re more likely to need a custom small-scale layout than a custom page
layout. If the desired layout can’t be easily achieved using a single stack
component, create a custom layout.

Custom small-scale layouts can often be done as part of a functional component,
such as the timeline input shown here. It’s also possible to create dedicated
small-scale layout components if the layout needs to be reusable.

<div class="Spacing">
<div class="Image">

![A row of UI elements on a wide screen, showing one element pushing two others to the right. A second state of the same element is shown on a narrower screen. The two smaller elements have wrapped below the first, creating a new row. Now one element stretches to fill the row and pushes last element to the end.](/public_images/layout-page/layout-small-scale-custom@2x.png)

</div>
</div>

## Placing actions on screen

Organizing actions is as important as organizing content.

If an action applies to the entire page:

- Place it in the page header as a primary or secondary action
- Use the [page actions](/components/structure/page-actions) component for
  page-level delete and save actions

If an action applies to something more specific, place it at the level of the
content it affects. For example, if an action applies to the contents of a card:

- Use card header actions for less important actions, or those that don’t
  benefit from reviewing the contents of the card. For example, merchants may
  want to add items to a card containing a long list.
- Use card footer actions for a card’s most important actions, or actions that
  benefit from reviewing the contents of the card. For example, merchants
  should review the contents of a shipment before cancelling or adding tracking
  information.

---

## Combining navigation with layout

Always consider the full range of screen sizes when designing layouts.

If a page has become complex, overloaded with content, or hard to navigate by
scrolling on a phone, it can be broken up into a core page and secondary pages
accessible via navigation.
