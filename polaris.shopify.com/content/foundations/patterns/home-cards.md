# Home cards

Home cards make actionable recommendations based on data from the merchant’s store, or give merchants feedback about their store’s performance.

Home cards should:

- track progress and give feedback
- teach and educate
- inspire and motivate
- be data-driven and use data from the merchant’s store

## Home card types

When choosing a home card type, think about the simplest way to present your message. For example, if the goal of the card is to inform merchants about holiday shipping deadlines, then a table is probably the best way to present this information. Alternatively, if your goal is to recognize merchant success, consider using a large illustration with some encouraging content.

## Content

In general, home card content should follow this format:

- The **heading** should clearly state the merchant benefit or primary data point. Keep headings to a single sentence fragment and don’t use punctuation at the end.
- **Body** content should explain the value or significance of the information in the heading, and provide next steps. Body content should be concise and no longer than two sentences.
- The **primary call-to-action** should be clear, predictable, and actionable. A merchant should anticipate where the [call-to-action button](/content/actionable-language#section-buttons) takes them. Call-to-action buttons are action-led (verb + noun format), and shouldn’t exceed 34 characters in length.
- A **secondary call-to-action** links to a [Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/) article or a [Shopify Blog](https://www.shopify.com/blog) post. Include a secondary action whenever educational content is available for the topic of the home card. The button content is always “Learn more”.

## Voice and tone

A good home card prioritizes merchant needs over Shopify’s needs. Home cards are not advertisements, status updates, or [error messages](/patterns/error-messages).

The tone changes depending on the context or situation of a card, but it should always be empathetic. For example, for a message about a negative situation, the tone should be considerate and encouraging, with a recommended action on how to fix it.
