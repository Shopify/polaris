## When to use the [New] badge

The [New] badge should be used on features that have all of these 3 characteristics:

- We want to drive adoption of this feature
- It’s creating new value for merchants (not just an improved way of doing something they are already doing)
- It’s worth distracting our merchants from their current workflow to inform them about a whole new part of Shopify

Consider how the admin would look if it was cluttered with [New] badges or features of varying importance—overusing the badge creates unnecessary distraction and lessens its impact.

## How long to use the [New] badge

[New] badges should have a short lifespan. The badge should disappear:

- When the user has clicked on the interactive element it’s attached to, or
- 5 days after they first saw it, or
- after 3 sessions, such as landing on a page 3 times

### What the [New] badge should look like

- Use the [informational badge variant](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/badge) to achieve the correct styling and color
- the badge should be right aligned or placed to the right of text
- the [page component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/page) in Polaris already places badges to the right of headings, so following this logic adds to the consistency of [New] badge use in the admin.
