# Error messages

Error messages can be scary. Make errors visible to merchants, easy to
understand, and helpful.

Error messages should:

- Tell merchants what happened. If there’s a solution, explain it. If possible,
  offer a one-click fix with a button. If there’s
  [no solution](#errors-without-solutions), give troubleshooting instructions.
- Be placed close to the source of the problem.
- Communicate severity using the appropriate [color](#colors) and
  [tone of voice](#voice-and-tone).
- Use
  [plain language](/content/product-content#section-write-for-a-grade-7-reading-level).
- Be specific. For example, use precise
  [numbers and dates](/content/grammar-and-mechanics#section-dates-numbers-and-addresses).
- Be brief.

Good design can reduce the need for error messages by preventing them in the
first place.

---

## Error message types

Think about the scope of the error when selecting a message type. Is something
wrong with the entire application, with the entire current screen, or with a
specific element on the screen?

If the cause of the error is visible and the error just happened, show the error
message immediately and as close to the source of the problem as possible.

## Error colors

Red is the scariest error color. Only use red for critical messages that
merchants need to deal with immediately to avoid harm to their business. For
example, if merchants don’t act on the message right away, they might lose
money or their store might be suspended.

Yellow error messages still demand attention, but are more appropriate for
messages that are part of a daily workflow.

<a name="colors-critical"></a>

### Red (critical)

Use critical messages to:

- Bring attention to urgent tasks. If not dealt with immediately, merchants'
  businesses will be noticeably impacted, like an account being suspended or
  money being lost.

Examples of critical message types:

- Update a payment method expiry date
- Unsuspend an account
- Review an order for fraud
- Fix a problem that’s preventing payment from being processed

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

![Red banner with high fraud risk message](/public_images/errors-page/red-banner@2x.png)

#### Don’t

![Yellow banner with high fraud risk message](/public_images/errors-page/yellow-banner@2x.png)

<!-- end -->

The one exception to using red is in form validation errors because this is a
standard convention merchants are used to seeing outside of Shopify.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Don’t

![Form validation with yellow banner](/public_images/errors-page/validation-banner-yellow@2x.png)

<!-- end -->

<a name="colors-warning"></a>

### Yellow (warning)

Use warning messages to:

- Help merchants fix issues so they can complete a common workflow or continue
  to the next step
- Notify merchants about upcoming expirations or pending requests that, if not
  dealt with soon, could lead to problems in the future

Examples of warning message types:

- Fix a problem before proceeding to the next step.
- Fix a problem at some point in a common workflow.
- There’s a pending request.
- There’s an upcoming expiration.
- Changing a setting might have unintended consequences. See
  [settings warning](#settings-warning).

## Anti-patterns

### Avoid using toast for error messages

<div class="Annotated">
  <div class="Annotated__Text">
    <p>
      Although error toast is still available, we discourage its use. Toast messages are too short to adequately explain what went wrong and how to fix the problem. Because the toast component appears at the bottom of the screen and disappears after 3 seconds, it can easily be missed. Reserve toast for errors not caused by merchants, like a connection issue. Always try to use a banner to inform merchants about persistent errors.

<!-- end -->

</div>
</div>

### Don’t use modals for errors

<div class="Annotated">
  <div class="Annotated__Text">
    <p>
      Modal dialogs are a good way to ask merchants to confirm a
      destructive action, but not to tell them an error has occurred.
      Modals block merchants until a decision is made, which is
      likely to make merchants feel pressured. Most errors don’t need
      to block access to the rest of the feature.

<a name="form-validation"></a>

## Form validation

<a name="validate-while-typing"></a>

### Text field validation

Use when:

- A text field has formatting requirements. Use this pattern to enhance
  [validation on form submission](#validate-on-submit).

Don’t use when:

- It takes
  [more than a full second](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#ux)
  to validate input and display a message. If there’s a lag before a validation
  message appears, merchants might shift their attention and miss the error.
  Either find a way to improve the validation speed, or rely on the
  [validation after form submission](#validate-on-submit).
- The field is empty. Merchants might tab through a form before filling it out, and errors on empty fields can cause confusion and frustration.

### Component:

<div class="Annotated">
  <div class="Annotated__Text">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/components/forms/text-field">Text field</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Content:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use two or three words to explain what’s wrong or what’s
        needed to fix the problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid using the word "invalid" to define an error. When appropriate, use "not valid" instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since the message is directly below the text field, the copy only
        needs to explain why the error happened. Optionally, the message can
        clarify what to do next or offer a one-click fix.
      </li>
    </p>
  </div>
<div class="Annotated__Media">
<div class="Image Image--border">

![Text field validation error](/public_images/errors-page/text-field-validation-error-no-cursor@2x.png)

</div>

</div>
</div>

**Usage**

Do an initial validation check as soon as merchants finish typing in the
field.

Merchants can be considered to be finished typing only when keyboard focus
moves away from the field and there is at least one character in the field. This
helps avoid marking the field as not valid before merchants are really done typing.

<div class="Image">

![Initial validation check with purple border](/public_images/errors-page/text-field-validation-purple-incorrect-input@2x.png)

</div>

If the validation check fails, show an error message below the field.

<div class="Image">

![Text field turns red](/public_images/errors-page/text-field-validation-error-no-cursor@2x.png)

</div>

Once a field has an error, complete validation checks after each keystroke.

<div class="Image">

![Text field validation with cursor by incorrect semi colon](/public_images/errors-page/text-field-validation-cursor@2x.png)

</div>

Remove the error message as soon as the input becomes valid so merchants can
immediately tell they fixed the issue.

<div class="Image">

![Text field validation with purple border](/public_images/errors-page/text-field-validation-purple-border-cursor@2x.png)

</div>

If the validation process is less than a second but not instant, show a spinner
on the field to indicate validation progress.

<div class="Image">

![Text field validation in loading state with spinner](/public_images/errors-page/text-field-validation-loading@2x.png)

</div>

---

<a name="validate-on-submit"></a>

## Validate on submit

Validate on submit is triggered when merchants press the form’s submit

button. The submit button is often \[Save\], but can be another call to action.

Use when:

- Not all fields can be validated while merchants are typing. When a form is used
  for saving data, always validate on submit and validate text fields while
  typing. For example, if merchants never interact with a required text field,
  there’s no change to mark it as not valid until they press the submit button.
  The same applies to form controls other than text fields, such as radio
  buttons, and selects.

Don’t use when:

- A form doesn’t have specific validation requirements, or the form doesn’t save
  data. For example, a search form that returns no results should display an
  empty state, rather than a validation error.

### Component:

![Red form validation banner](/public_images/errors-page/validation-banner-red@2x.png)

</div>
</div>
</div>

Rather than pointing out that there are {x} number of errors, be more
descriptive. Explain that in order to save or continue, {x} number of fields
need to be changed. For the bullet point instructions, see if you can word them
to be more actionable, for example, “Add a discount code,“ instead of “Discount
can’t be blank.“

<!-- end -->

**Usage**

Always indicate submission progress. If the fields aren't valid, don’t clear or alter them on behalf of merchants during validation.

## Settings warning

Use:

- To help merchants prevent potential mistakes
- When form input is valid, but you want to warn merchants of a consequence
  they might not be expecting

Don’t use:

- For actual error states

Tip: Explore ways to prevent the warning message from showing at all. Look for
opportunities to add help text or other contextual information to surface or
highlight potential risks or consequences of taking, or not taking, the action.

### Page-level banners

Use when:

- An error applies to the entire screen
- The error is far down the page and it’s critical that they see the message
- [A form was submitted with fields that are not valid](#form-validation)

For multiple error guidelines, see [validate on submit](#validate-on-submit)

Page-level banner errors should explain:

- Where the error happened
- What happened
- Why it happened
- What to do next

## Home notifications

Home notifications are primarily used to prevent merchants from losing money or
help them continue using Shopify if they don’t act on the error message
instructions immediately.

Use for:

- High-priority tasks that must be completed immediately to continue using
  Shopify or avoid losing money.
- Important enough tasks that we wouldn’t want merchants to navigate to another
  place in Shopify to find it, or stumble upon while completing another task.
- Errors for features that don’t have a dedicated details page. For example, before
  Shopify Capital had a details page, related status messages were temporarily
  surfaced in Home.

Don’t use for:

- Tips or advice
- Positive feedback
- Confirmation messages
- New feature announcements
- Status messages, other than those for Shopify Capital
- Messages that can be displayed in context
- Error messages that should be displayed in context
- Task-related errors like a problem with saving a page

<a name="warning-home-notifications"></a>

### Warning home notifications

Warning home notifications are pre-emptive. They let merchants know that their
finances will be impacted if action isn’t taken in a couple days or more, or
that an action can be taken to make money sooner.

- Financing request is pending
- Warn about upcoming expiration
- Pending status, like with Shopify Capital application status

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

#### Don’t

![Warning home notification with chargeback message](/public_images/errors-page/dont-home-notification@2x.png)

<!-- end -->

<a name="warning-home-notifications"></a>

### Critical home notifications

Critical home notifications inform merchants of issues that:

- Currently impact their finances
- Will have an impact on their finances if action isn’t taken immediately
- Prevent the normal operation of their business or account

Critical home notifications can be used for these message types:

- Trial expired
- Domain expired
- Credit card expired
- Account is suspended
- Shopify Payment payouts on hold
- Payment processing issues
- Payment authorizations expiring that day

<a name="admin-unavailable-errors"></a>

## Admin unavailable errors

Sometimes the admin can’t be displayed due to a network issue, browser
limitation, connection problem, or server issue. 400 and 500 series errors fall
in this category. In these cases, always explain what went wrong and provide
merchants with a troubleshooting step, like refreshing the page.

Use when:

- A page or the entire admin can’t be displayed

Don’t use when:

- The error can be placed in context, close to the source of the problem

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

![Page not found error with internet connection message](/public_images/errors-page/page-not-found-02@2x.png)

#### Don’t

![Page not found error with oops, something went wrong message](/public_images/errors-page/dont-page-not-found@2x.png)

<!-- end -->

Don’t use internal language in error messages and avoid using question formats.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

#### Don’t

![Problem loading page error with content that talks about operational engineers](/public_images/errors-page/dont-admin-error@2x.png)

<a name="errors-without-solutions"></a>

## Errors without solutions

When a service issue occurs in Shopify or is caused by a third party, we don’t
always have a solution to offer to merchants. In these cases, always explain
what went wrong so they can attempt to troubleshoot. If available,
provide them with a troubleshooting step, like refreshing the page or
returning at a later time.

Use when:

- Merchants are being denied access to a page or the entire admin
  [See admin unavailable errors](#admin-unavailable-errors)
- A third party issue is causing a disruption to merchants’ workflows

Don’t use when:

- There’s literally any solution we can offer to merchants

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

![Carrier may not be able to pick up package error message](/public_images/errors-page/warning-no-solution-2@2x.png)

#### Don’t

- Don’t use the “Something went wrong. Please try again in a few minutes.”
  message when there’s any option to offer more context.

<!-- end -->

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- This error message is a last resort: "Something went wrong. Please try again in
  a few minutes."

#### Don’t

- An error occurred
- 1 error
- Invalid

<!-- end -->

## Voice and tone

<!-- keywords: please -->

These content guidelines are based on common copy mistakes. Avoid sounding
overly apologetic, too technical, or hyperbolic. Keep Shopify out of the
conversation unless Shopify was the cause of the error. Don’t downplay the error
by telling merchants not to worry or by adding humor to a negative situation.

Avoid the word “please” so it’s not overused throughout the admin. Don’t
downplay serious problems.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Some of today’s sales data isn’t updated yet. This will be fixed soon. Your
  data is safe, and your actual sales are not affected.

#### Don’t

- Today’s sales data **might** not be accurate, but **please don’t worry—it’s
  just temporary**.

<!-- end -->

Don’t use scary, technical words in error messages.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Product weight can’t be negative. Change the product weight to be 0 or higher
  and try again.

#### Don’t

- **Error** **Line items grams** must be greater than or equal to 0.

<!-- end -->

Error messages are not the place for hyperbole or injecting personality.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- High risk of fraud detected

Before fulfilling this order or capturing payment, review the Risk Analysis and
determine if this order is fraudulent.

#### Don’t

- **Uh oh! High risk of fraud detected**

Looks like there’s a high fraud risk with this order. Better review the Risk
Analysis to make sure the order is safe!

<!-- end -->

Don’t use internal Shopify terms. Only include the information merchants need.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- There’s a problem loading this page

There’s a technical problem with Shopify that has prevented this page from
loading. Try reloading this page or going to another page in Shopify. If that
doesn’t work, visit our status page for updates and try again later.

#### Don’t

- There’s a technical problem with Shopify that has prevented this page from
  loading. **Our operation engineers are aware of this problem and are working
  hard to get it solved**.

<!-- end -->

Keep Shopify out of the conversation. Focus on the information merchants need
to complete their task efficiently.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Before you can view earnings from your store, you need to complete your
  account setup. [Complete account setup]

#### Don’t

- Before **we** can provide you with earnings from your store, **we** need some
  additional information. [Complete account setup]

<!-- end -->
