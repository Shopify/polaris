### Fresh visual style

A clean, simple style makes things feel approachable and&nbsp;efficient.

### Faster performance

Elegant code and lightweight assets means pages load&nbsp;more&nbsp;quickly.

### Future-friendliness

Built for flexibility, design tokens and new infrastructure let us iterate easily across&nbsp;experiences.

### Purposeful brand presence

Being intentional about when the Shopify brand comes forward, and when it takes a backseat, directs the focus to where it&nbsp;matters&nbsp;most.

### Familiarity across experiences

Defined patterns and guidelines help us design a wide variety of experiences that still always feel&nbsp;like&nbsp;Shopify.
