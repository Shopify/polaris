# Vocabulary

It’s important to use the same words, spelling, and capitalization consistently,
otherwise things start looking messy and confusing for merchants.

In general, if a feature or product isn’t unique to Shopify, such as a blog, then don’t capitalize it. If it’s unique to Shopify and marketable as
its own product, such as Shopify Shipping, then capitalize it. Edge cases are
assessed individually and documented here.

Use American English spelling for all merchant-facing content. When in doubt,
check the [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for the
preferred spelling of specific terms not found in this list.
