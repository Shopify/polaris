## Be consistent

To help your audience understand key concepts and actions they can take, use consistent nouns (words used to identify people, places, or things) and verbs
(action words) wherever possible.

### Tips

- Get in the habit of making a list of all the most important verbs and nouns in the experience you’re building.
- Look at your word list. Does each word clearly describe the object or action it represents in the simplest way possible?
- Does your language reflect how people think and the words they use?
- Identify synonyms (a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language), and eliminate them. Each important object and action should have a single word to represent it.
