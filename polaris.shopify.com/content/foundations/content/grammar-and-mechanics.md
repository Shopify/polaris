# Grammar and mechanics

This guide is to help designers, developers, recruiters, UX-ers, product
managers, support advisors, or anyone who writes public-facing text for Shopify.

---

## Basics

<!-- keywords: active voice, passive voice, contractions, plain language, reading levels, past tense, your, referring to yourself , referring to Shopify, abbreviated words, abbreviating words, empathy -->

### Active voice

You should (almost) always write in the active voice:

- Subject (person/thing acting) verb (the action) object (receives the action)

Use the active voice if merchants need to do something. It should be clear
that the subject is the one doing the action.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

Add details to the product

#### Don’t

Details were added to the product

<!-- end -->

### Passive voice

To tell if you’re using the passive voice, look out for:

- When the object comes before the subject (“the item was purchased by the
  customer”)
- Past tense verbs (“was added,” “was created,” and so on)
- Forms of the verb “to be” (“was,” “is,” “were,” and so on)

You should almost always write in the active voice, but here’s when to use the
passive voice:

- To avoid referring to yourself or Shopify
- To make it clear that you didn’t personally take an action or make a decision
- If the object (thing being done) is more important than the subject (person
  doing the thing)

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Invoices are created monthly and emailed to
[marki.yeung@nomail.com](mailto:Marki.Yeung@nomail.com)

#### Don’t

Shopify creates and emails your invoices monthly to
[simran.robichaud@nomail.com](mailto:Simran.Robichaud@nomail.com)

<!-- end -->

### Contractions

Contractions are abbreviated words. We use them to set a light and casual tone
in the interface. The goal is to sound human, so avoid contracting verbs that
sound awkward when you say them out loud, or have been phased out of modern day
speech.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- You can’t have products with negative weights
- Your products don’t have weights
- You’re all set up
- This product doesn’t require shipping

- An error occurred and your changes couldn’t be saved
- I’m Kit, your digital marketing assistant
- This transfer hasn’t been received
- You haven’t connected your account

<!-- end -->

### Plain language

Use words and language that our merchants use. Avoid jargon or technical
terminology. Make sure each sentence has a single focus and keep them short. Aim
for a Grade 7 reading level.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- We’ve made some changes to improve your store’s security
- These products aren’t getting a lot of views, but visitors are adding them to
  their carts

#### Don’t

## Capitalization

<!-- keywords: heading capitalization, proper nouns, product names, feature names, job titles, position titles, position names, roles, slashes, forward slashes, sentence case, title case, lowercase, lower case, uppercase, upper case, what words are capitalized?, trademarks, third party brands, third-party brands -->

### Headings

Use sentence case for all headings:

- Capitalize the first word of a heading
- Capitalize proper or trademarked nouns (names of products, countries, or
  people)
- Lowercase for everything else

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

Create purchase order

#### Don’t

Create Purchase Order

<!-- end -->

### Product and feature names

In general, if a feature or product isn’t unique to Shopify, don’t capitalize it
(such as blogs, navigation, pages). If it’s unique to Shopify and marketable as its
own product, capitalize it (such as Shopify Payments, or Frenzy).

For all terms and definitions, check our full
[vocabulary list](/content/vocabulary).

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- blogs
- navigation
- Shopify Payments

#### Don’t

- Blogs
- Navigation
- shopify payments

<!-- end -->

### Trademarks

Respect the usage guidelines of any third-party intellectual property. For
example, in US communications, Apple Pay requires you to include the trademark
symbol (™) the first time Apple Pay appears in body copy.

Review the third party’s brand usage guidelines to make sure you are using the
company’s name and logo correctly.

### Job titles

Job titles should be capitalized when they come before or after a person’s name. When
referring to a job title without referencing a name, don’t capitalize the job
title.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Content Strategist Jane Smith
- Jane Smith, Content Strategist
- Jane Smith is a content strategist.
- The content strategist designed the information architecture.

#### Don’t

- content strategist Jane Smith
- Jane Smith, content strategist
- Jane Smith is a Content Strategist
- The Content Strategist redesigned the information architecture.

<!-- end -->

### Letters following slashes

The first letter following a slash shouldn’t be capitalized.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

ZIP/postal code required

#### Don’t

ZIP/Postal code required

<!-- end -->

---

## Headings and subheadings

See the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](/content/actionable-language#section-headings-and-subheadings) in the actionable language section.

---

## Lists

<!-- keywords: bulleted lists, numbered lists, dropdown menu lists, drop down menu lists, action lists, menu actions, menu nouns, nouns in a menu, nouns in menu, list capitalization, list punctuation, list help text, list descriptions, menu lists, list in a menu, list in a drop down, list in a dropdown, list in drop downs, list in dropdowns -->

### Bulleted

Use a bulleted list when items are related but sequence or priority doesn’t
matter.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Use Shopify Payments to:

- Avoid the hassle of setting up a third-party payment gateway
- Track your payout schedule from the Shopify admin
- Minimize lost sales from chargebacks

#### Don’t

Use Shopify payments to

- avoid the hassle of setting up a gateway,
- track pending payout schedule,
- minimize lost sales from chargebacks. And eliminate PCI fees

<!-- end -->

### Numbered

Use a numbered list when item sequence or priority does matter, such as step-by-step instructions.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

To set up Shopify Payments:

1.  Go to Settings from Shopify admin
2.  Select Shopify Payments
3.  Select Setup

#### Don’t

To set up Shopify Payments:

1.  Go to Settings from Shopify admin Then select Shopify Payments
2.  Select Setup

<!-- end -->

### Dropdown menus

#### Actions in a menu

Menu lists give users a horizontal set of actions when space is limited. The
order of actions is often based on logic such as most popular actions.

Actions in a menu follow a {verb}+{noun} pattern. If there’s enough context,
only a verb might be required.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Rename
- Edit
- HTML
- Duplicate

#### Don’t

- HTML
- editing options
- File name changes
- Duplicate this order so that you can make edits, updates, or changes

<!-- end -->

#### Nouns in a menu

Menu lists give users a horizontal set of nouns when space is limited. The order
of nouns is often based on logic such as most recent orders.

Nouns in a menu should be concise but still give the user enough information so
they can easily find and accurately select the item they want.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Select filter

- Today
- Yesterday
- This week
- This month

#### Don’t

- Filter visibility
- Filter product type
- Filter product vendor
- Filter tagged with

<!-- end -->

### Capitalization

- List items always start with a capital letter.
- Capitalization and punctuation rules apply to both bulleted and numbered
  lists.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Company name

- Hidden
- Optional
- Required

#### Don’t

Company name

- hidden
- optional
- required

<!-- end -->

### Punctuation

- Introduce bulleted lists with a colon or a heading.
- Don’t use commas at the end of list items (for bulleted or numbered lists).
- If any list item contains two or more sentences, punctuate all list items.
- If all list items are one sentence or fragments, don’t punctuate.
- Never put a comma or semicolon at the end of a bulleted or numbered list item.
  Treat each list item as a self-contained piece of information.

## Dates, numbers, and measurements

<!-- keywords: date format, ordinal indicators, time, 12 hour clock, 12-hour clock, 24-hour clock, 24 hour clock, currency format, number format, phone number format, phone numbers format, numbers format, dates format, hyphens, en dashes, dashes, ranges, downward ranges, upward ranges, units of measurements, unit of measurement, time stamp, timezone -->

These guidelines are for American English, which is the language we use as a base before translating to other languages. However, dates, numbers, and measurements may be formatted differently in other languages. You can use [helpers](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt) to ensure they are localized automatically.

### Date

When possible, use the month’s full name, for example, October. If there are
space constraints, use 3-letter abbreviations, for example, Oct. Don’t write
dates numerically, for example, 07-02-14.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Thursday, October 15, 2015
- October 15, 2015
- Oct 15, 2015

#### Don’t

- Thur, October 15
- October 15, ’15
- 10/15/15

<!-- end -->

Don’t use ordinal indicators, which are words representing position or rank in a
sequential order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on).

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

January 23–April 1

#### Don’t

January 23rd–April 1st

<!-- end -->

### Time:

- Use the 12-hour clock, followed by am or pm.
- Include a space after the last number. For example, “Your package will
  arrive at 12:35 pm.” Adding the space helps with formatting for English-speaking markets outside of North America, so we use it for North American usage as well.
- Use the browser time of the logged in user.
- To show a time range, use an en dash and include the am/pm after both times,
  for example, 3:00 pm–4:00 pm.
- If indicating both the date and time, separate them with the word “at” instead of a comma.

#### Time zones

- Include a time zone only if it’s necessary, such as for an event listing.
- Use the time zone’s abbreviation following the am or pm, for example, 4:00 pm NZT.
- If your audience is in a single time zone, then don’t include an S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight). For example, 3:00 pm PT.
- If your audience is in a combination of time zones, then include the S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight) to avoid confusion. For example, 3:00 pm PDT.

For all translations, the time format is automatically localized by the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` JavaScript object.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Thursday, October 15, 2015 at 2:00 pm EDT

## Addresses and places

<!-- keywords: country, countries, provinces, states, country adjectives, abbreviated country, country punctuation, country abbreviations, address, address format, address line 1, address line 2, shipping address, delivery address -->

### Address

Lay out address forms in the following format:

```
First name             Last name
Address
Apartment, suite, etc. (optional)
City
Country            Province           Postal code
```

Please note, “optional” in `Apartment, suite, etc. (optional)` means that the
field is optional for customers to complete, but we should always include it in
the form.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Use locale-specific alternatives for province and postal code, for example,
  the US uses State and ZIP code

#### Don’t

- Add extra fields
- Change the placeholder text

<!-- end -->

### Country, province, and state names

Use a nation’s proper name when referring to it as a noun.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

Your store must be located in the United States.

#### Don’t

Your store must be located in the US.

<!-- end -->

When using a country as an adjective (such as when referring to currency), use the abbreviated form without punctuation.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

Pinterest requires your store to use US currency.

#### Don’t

U.S. currency

<!-- end -->

Things to watch out for:

- Don’t use colloquial forms of a nation or state name, for example, America instead of the
  United States
- Search online to see whether nations commonly use “the” before their name, for example, the
  Philippines or the Falkland Islands

---

## Punctuation

<!-- keywords: ampersands, apostrophes, omitted numbers, omitted letters, verb contractions, possessives, colons, commas, ellipses, truncation, truncating, exclamation marks, en-dashes, em-dashes, en dashes, em dashes, hyphens, periods, question marks, quotes, quoting, quotation marks, semicolons, semi colons, semi-colons, smart quotes, smart apostrophes -->

### Ampersands

Don’t use ampersands (&). They attract attention to the least important part of
the sentence. Spell out the word “and.”

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

Zones and rates

#### Don’t

Zones & rates

<!-- end -->

### Apostrophes

Use apostrophes to represent omitted letters or numbers:

- Omitted numbers (’40s)
- Omitted letters (don’t, can’t, won’t)
- Verb contractions (it’s, you’re, we’re)

Use apostrophes to form possessives:

- Singular nouns: add _’s_, even if they end in _s_ (merchant’s,
  bus’s)
- Plural nouns that don’t end in s: add _’s_ (women’s, men’s)
- Plural nouns that end in s: add an apostrophe (boxes’, customers’)

Don’t use apostrophes to form possessive pronouns such as hers or his.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Merchant’s store
- Women’s clothing
- Customers’ credit cards

#### Don’t

- Merchants store
- Womens clothing
- Customers credit cards

<!-- end -->

Always use apostrophes, not vertical (straight) quotes.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">’</span>
  <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>

#### Don’t

<code style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; background-color: transparent">...</code>

<!-- end -->

#### Truncation

Consider constraints of the space in the interface when deciding to use
truncation. Think about what part of the string merchants needs most. It’s
usually the beginning or end, which means you might have to truncate the middle
of the string.

#### Ellipses button component

A button with an ellipsis icon (not the same as text) is used to expand more
actions. It’s typically used in cards, or for horizontal sets of actions when
space is limited. Android uses a vertical version (vertically stacked dots).

### Quotation marks

Use quotation marks to:

  or
  <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">'</span>

<!-- end -->
