          We store design tokens as Figma styles, which are available to all
          Shopify designers.

        <p>
          If you {`don't`} work at Shopify but still want to build with Polaris,
          you can access our styles by duplicating any of the Polaris for Admin
          files on{" "}
          <a href="https://www.figma.com/@shopify">
            {`Shopify's`} Figma community page
          </a>
          . Note that with this method, Shopify wonâ€™t be able to automatically
          push style updates to your local copy of the design file. Learn more
          about styles by{" "}
