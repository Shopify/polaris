/**
 * For some reason when the Banner component is hydrated on the client the css
 * variables are incorrect, causing the top border-radius of the component to
 * not get set correctly. Disabling SSR via the documentation below resolves
 * this hydration issue, but I'm not sure what the root cause of this problem is.
 * This is a temporary fix until we can dig into things furthur
 *
 * To see the hydration error, remove lines 17-20 and import the Banner component
 * as you normally would. Then load the page with the banner component example
 * and open up the dev console.
