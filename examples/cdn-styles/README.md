# Example App: CDN Styles

Demonstrates Polaris components using pure HTML/CSS. The only requirement is to include the CSS file in your HTML document. Once that step is completed, you can refer to the [Polaris Style Guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/) for HTML sample implementations of our components.

## Dependencies

The CDN hosted CSS file needs to be included in your HTML document. Replace the version number with the version you wish to use. We recommend using a fixed version number so that you are not adversely impacted by changes to our CSS classes between versions.

## Getting Started

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://sdks.shopifycdn.com/polaris/3.20.0/polaris.min.css"
/>
```

Refer to the [Polaris Style Guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/) for more HTML sample implementations of our components.
