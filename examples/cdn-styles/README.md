# Example App: CDN Styles

Demonstrates Polaris components using pure HTML/CSS. The only requirement is to include the CSS file in your HTML document. Once that step is completed, you can refer to the [Polaris Style Guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/) for HTML sample implementations of our components.

## Dependencies

The CDN hosted CSS file needs to be included in your HTML document. Replace the version number with the version you wish to use. We recommend using a fixed version number so that you are not adversely impacted by changes to our CSS classes between versions. We suggest copying the styles file into your own project, but you may also use it directly:

## Getting Started

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/@shopify/polaris@5.0.0/dist/styles.css"
/>
```

Refer to the [Polaris Style Guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/) for more HTML sample implementations of our components.
