# Releasing

Polaris uses Changsets to handle releasing the npm packages in repository.

We have a [GitHub](https://github.com/changesets/action) action that

- creates a `version` PR, then keeps it up to date, recreating it when merged. This PR always has an up-to-date run of `changeset version`
- optionally allows you to do releases when changes are merged to the `main` branch.

## Prereleases

To create a new prerelease:

1. Branch of the `next` branch
1. Create changesets with your changes
1. Set your target merge branch to `next`
1. The GitHub release workflow will generated a PR for your prerelease branch ðŸŽ‰
