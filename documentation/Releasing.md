# Releasing

Polaris uses [Changsets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to handle releasing the npm packages in repository.

We have a [GitHub action](https://github.com/changesets/action) that

- creates a `version` PR called **"Version Packages"**, then keeps it up to date, recreating it when merged. This PR always has an up-to-date run of `changeset version`
- performs a releases when changes are merged to the `main` branch.

To perform a release:

- Comment `/snapit` in the **"Version Packages"** PR to cut a snapshot release
- Create a draft pull request in `Shopify/web` for the upgrade using the snapshot
- Once CI passes, merge the **"Version Packages"** PR
- Once the release is available in npm, update the draft PR to the new version and request review from the folks whose changes are part of the release as listed in the release notes 

## Snapshot Release

[Snapshot releases](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/snapshot-releases.md) are a way to release your changes for testing without updating the versions. To create a snapshot release:

1. Add a comment in your feature branch PR with the slash command "/snapit"
2. This will trigger the `snapit.yml` workflow to create a new snapshot release

> Note: Your feature branch PR should have **at least one** changeset. The snapshot release will only release packages with a pending changeset. More info on [adding a changeset](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/blob/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-changeset).
