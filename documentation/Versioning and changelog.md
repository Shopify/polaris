# Versioning and Changelog

The changelog is prepared manually immediately before a release. Each changelog entry should follow this structure:

```md
## 2.0.0 - 2018-05-07

### Breaking changes

* A change ([#100](https://github.com/shopify/polaris/pull/100))
```

The possible groups in which to categorize changes are:

* Breaking changes
* New components
* Enhancements (new variations, accessibility improvements, etc.)
* Design updates (non-breaking design changes implemented in code)
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Dependency upgrades

## Out of scope for CHANGELOG.md

Generally, changes related to these topics can be omitted:

* Style guide (update the [“What’s new” page](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-styleguide/tree/master/pages/whats-new) instead)
* Sketch UIKit (unless noteworthy)
* Dev dependencies upgrades
* Chores (infrastructure, release process…)

## Unreleased changes

Unreleased changes must go under the `## Unreleased` section (inspired by <https://keepachangelog.com>):

```md
## Unreleased

### Bug fixes

* Fixed something ([#100](https://github.com/shopify/polaris/pull/100))
```

This heading must be commented (leaving it for an easy future use) when publishing a release:

```md
<!-- ## Unreleased -->
```

## Versioning scheme

Because we expose both React components (for which the markup, including class names, is an implementation detail) and static CSS/Sass builds, the versioning scheme for Polaris is somewhat unusual. The following sections detail what kinds of changes result in each of major, minor, and patch version bumps:

### Major

* Removal of a component
* Removal of a prop from a component
* Change to the type accepted for a prop
* Breaking changes to minimum version of dependencies
* Breaking changes to Sass functions and mixins

### Minor

* Breaking change to the HTML generated by a component, including addition, removal, or renaming of classes
* New component
* New prop for a component
* Additional type accepted for a prop
* Changes to the UI Kit that do not result in breaking changes

### Patch

* Bug fixes that do not result in breaking changes to markup
* Non-breaking changes to minimum version of dependencies
