# Tophatting documentation 🎩

## Summary

When components are updated in ways that impact how people use them, their `README.md` documentation should be updated to reflect this.

When you update the `README.md` of a component, that content can change the documentation that appears in the [Polaris style guide](https://polaris.shopify.com/).

Manually testing documentation (we call it “[tophatting](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/blob/main/documentation/Tophatting.md#history-of-the-phrase)”, or 🎩 for short) adds that extra degree of certainty that what you’re shipping looks like what you expect.

## When should you 🎩 documentation?

When you’re adding content to a component’s `README.md` (such as `polaris-react/src/components/Button/README.md`) to change or add best practices, accessibility documentation, or other information.

## What should you 🎩?

Check the location, appearance, and readability of the content you add to the style guide.
