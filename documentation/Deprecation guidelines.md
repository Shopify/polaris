# Deprecation guidelines

- Ship backwards compatible changes which include supporting both the old and new API (make sure the full upgrade path is available)
- Support backwards compatibility for at least half of a major release cycle, but never more that 2 major release cycles
  - For example, before or part of 3.5, okay to remove in 4.0. After 3.5, remove in 5.0
  - Large changes consider a full major release cycle. For example, a large change in 3.1 would be removed in 5.0. But a large change in 2.9 would never wait until 5.0 to remove
- Use the `@deprecated` doc tag for props and components ([for example, add above where the component is defined](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/blob/8e49e4c65fbbf25d40617ba2d0ff0b3747320f17/src/components/Navigation/components/UserMenu/UserMenu.tsx#L27)), state the reason, and upgrade path
- Add a console warning for any respective `@deprecated` doc tag, state the reason, and state the upgrade path
  - Add the console warning in the constructor for classes and in the render method for functional components
- For significant deprecations, add a section to the component documentation with rationale. State the upgrade path and include a link to a new component if applicable
- Call out deprecations in our changelog

## Examples
