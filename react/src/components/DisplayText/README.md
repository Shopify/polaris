# Display text

Display styles make a bold visual statement. Use them to create impact when the
main goal is visual storytelling. For example, use display text to convince or
reassure merchants such as in marketing content or to capture attention during onboarding.

---

## Best practices

- Use when the primary goal of the page is communication rather than
  interaction.
- Use larger display text sizes when a page is focused around a single message.
  In these cases it may be paired with an illustration.
- Use smaller display text to pair with larger text, or alone as part of more
  complex data displays such as dashboards.

## Content guidelines

### Display text

Display text should be:

- Benefits-driven and focused on information that is most important to
  merchants
- Concise and scannable:
  - Use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance
  - Keep display text content to a short sentence that’s just a few words in
    length
  - Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons
  - Avoid using exclamation marks—display text already makes enough of a
    statement without an exclamation mark
  - Write in sentence case

## Examples

### Extra large

Use this size sparingly and never multiple times on the same page.

```jsx
<DisplayText size="extraLarge">Good evening, Dominic.</DisplayText>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Extra large display text](/public_images/components/DisplayText/android/extra-large@2x.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Extra large display text](/public_images/components/DisplayText/ios/extra-large@2x.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Large

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use for display text that’s more important than the medium size, but less important than extra large.

```jsx
<DisplayText size="large">Good evening, Dominic.</DisplayText>
```

### Medium

Use for display text that’s more important than the small size, but less important than large.

```jsx
<DisplayText size="medium">Good evening, Dominic.</DisplayText>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

![Medium and large display text](/public_images/components/DisplayText/android/medium-large@2x.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

![Medium and large display text](/public_images/components/DisplayText/ios/medium-large@2x.png)

<!-- /content-for -->

### Small

<!-- example-for: web -->

Use for text that would otherwise use body text, but that needs to scale with other display text.

```jsx
<DisplayText size="small">Good evening, Dominic.</DisplayText>
```

<!-- content-for: web -->

Although display text creates an interesting visual experience, it doesn’t replace the semantic structure provided by HTML headings.

By default, the display text component outputs text in an HTML paragraph (`<p>`). If a heading tag is needed for display text, use the `element` prop to set the heading level.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Use display text to create visual interest along with a meaningful heading structure.

#### Don’t

Use display text in place of standard headings. Use the [heading component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/titles-and-text/heading) and [subheading component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/titles-and-text/subheading) to provide structure.
