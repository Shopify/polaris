# Footer help

Footer help is used to refer merchants to more information related to the product or feature they’re using.

---

## Best practices

Footer help should:

- Be positioned at the bottom of the interface
- Provide links to help that’s related to the experience on the screen
- Not be used to promote features or provide explanations for how something works
- Never link to information designed to upsell to merchants
- In rare cases, link to blog posts when there isn’t any help documentation to help merchants with the most logical next step in the workflow

If you’re a Shopify app developer, footer help could also:

- Provide links to contact information or a support ticketing system

It’s recommended to link your footer help component to [help documentation](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/help-documentation). Linking directly to your contact information might result in receiving a higher number of emails or calls.

## Content guidelines

### Footer help

By default, footer help should link to information in the Shopify Help Center and should follow this content pattern:

- Learn more about {X}.

Links should be:

Clearly labeled: Merchants shouldn’t need to guess where they’ll end up if they click on an action link. Never use “click here” as a link because it doesn’t set expectations about what’s next.

For Shopify app developers linking to contact information, footer help should follow this content pattern:

- Option 1: {Contact us} about [X].
- Option 2: Reach out to us at {contact info}.

<!-- usagelist -->

#### Do

- Learn more about [shipping zones].
- [Contact us] about email marketing.

#### Don’t

- Go to [docs] to learn about zones.
- Find out about [themes].

<!-- end -->
