# Footer help

Footer help is used to refer merchants to more information in the Shopify Help documentation that’s related to the product or feature they’re using.

---

## Best practices

Footer help should:

- Be positioned at the bottom of the interface
- Provide links to help related to the experience on the screen
- Almost always provide a link to help documentation except in the rare case that a blog post or other type of content does a better job of walking the merchant through how to use the product or feature
- Not be used to promote features or provide explanations for how something works
- Never link to information designed to upsell the merchant

## Content guidelines

### Footer help

By default, footer help should link to information in the Shopify Help Center and should follow this content pattern:

- Learn more about {X}.

In the rare case that footer help links to a resource outside of the Shopify Help Center, it’s important to specify the destination by following this pattern:

- Learn more about {X} at the Shopify blog.

Links should be:

Clearly labeled: Merchants should not need to guess where they’ll end up if they click on an action link. Never use “click here” as a link because it doesn’t set expectations about what’s next.

#### Do
