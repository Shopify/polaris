# Button

Buttons make common actions immediately visible and easy to perform with one
click or tap. They can be used for any type of action, including navigation.

**Problem**

An action needs to be completed by a merchant.

**Solution**

The button component can be used to help merchants find and complete actions across Shopify.

## Best practices

Buttons should:

* Be clearly and accurately labeled.
* Lead with strong, actionable verbs.
* Use established button colors appropriately. For example, only use a red
button for an action that’s difficult or impossible to undo.
* Prioritize the most important actions. Too many calls to action can cause
confusion and make merchants unsure of what to do next.
* Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.

## Content guidelines

Buttons should be clear and predictable—merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive a merchant by mislabeling a button.

<!-- usagelist -->
#### Do
- Create order
- Buy shipping label

#### Don't
- New order
- Buy
<!-- end -->

Buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages
action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on
buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.

<!-- usagelist -->
#### Do
- Activate Apple Pay
- View shipping settings

#### Don't
- Try Apple Pay
- View your settings
<!-- end -->

Buttons should be scannable—avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.

<!-- usagelist -->
#### Do
Add menu item

#### Don't
Add a menu item
<!-- end -->

## Examples

### Basic button

Used most in the interface. Only use another style if a button requires more or less visual weight.

```jsx
<Button>Add product</Button>
```

### Outline button

Use against shaded or colorful backgrounds. An outline button will maintain the appropriate visual weight and won’t clash with the background color.

```jsx
<Button outline>Add product</Button>
```

### Plain button

Use for less important or less commonly used actions since they’re less prominent. For example, plain buttons are used as secondary actions in card headers.

```jsx
<Button plain>View shipping settings</Button>
```

### Primary buttons

Use to highlight the most important actions in any experience. Don’t use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overwhelming merchants.

```jsx
<Button primary>Save theme</Button>
```

### Destructive buttons

Use when the action will delete merchant data or be otherwise difficult to recover from. Destructive buttons should trigger a confirmation dialog before the action is completed. Be thoughtful about using destructive buttons because they can feel stressful for merchants.

```jsx
<Button destructive>Delete theme</Button>
```

### Slim buttons

Use when a table or list has a set of actions on each item to avoid making items taller than they need to be. Don’t use slim buttons for primary actions.

```jsx
<Button size="slim">Save variant</Button>
```

### Large buttons

Use for the main call to action in empty states or for calls to action shown with large illustrations.

```jsx
<Button size="large">Create store</Button>
```

### Full-width buttons

Use for buttons placed in a narrow column (especially when stacking multiple buttons) or for creating a set of buttons of equal width. Full-width buttons should rarely exceed 320px wide.

```jsx
<Button fullWidth>Add customer</Button>
```

### Disabled state

Use for actions that aren’t currently available. The surrounding interface should make it clear why the button is disabled and what needs to be done to enable it. Alternatively a button may be disabled because it’s been pressed and the associated action is in progress.

```jsx
<Button disabled>Buy shipping label</Button>
```
