# Button group

Button group displays multiple related actions stacked or in a horizontal row to help with arrangement and spacing.

---

## Best practices

Button groups should:

- Only use buttons that follow the
  [best practices outlined in the button component](/components/actions/button#best-practices)
- Group together calls to action that have a relationship
- Be used with consideration that too many calls to action can cause merchants
  to be unsure of what to do next
- Be thoughtful about how multiple buttons will look and work on small screens
- Only be used in groups of up to six buttons if the buttons contain an icon
  with no text

### Default button group

```jsx
<ButtonGroup>
  <Button>Cancel</Button>
  <Button primary>Save</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->

<!-- /content-for -->

<!-- content-for: ios -->

<!-- /content-for -->

### Button group with segmented buttons

Use to emphasize several buttons as a thematically-related set among other controls.

```jsx
<ButtonGroup segmented>
  <Button>Bold</Button>
  <Button>Italic</Button>
  <Button>Underline</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

<!-- content-for: android -->
