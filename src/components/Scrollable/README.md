# Scrollable

The scrollable component is a container for long form content, such as terms of service, that allows for scrolling so merchants can expose more text as they read.

---

## Best practices

Scrollable containers should:

- Be used when it’s helpful to provide an extra visual cue to let merchants
  know that content exists below or above the fold
- Only be used for length text such as terms of service or other legal
  disclaimers and never for instructional or action-oriented text

---

## Content guidelines

Scrollable containers are cards with scrolling functionality, and should follow the [content guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/card#section-content-guidelines) for cards.

---

## Examples

### Default scrollable container

Use when you need to make a region within the page independently scrollable. It’s often used in modals and other panes where it’s helpful to provide an extra visual cue that content exists below or above the fold.

```jsx
<Card title="Terms of service" sectioned>
  <Scrollable shadow style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <p>
      By signing up for the Shopify service (“Service”) or any of the services
      of Shopify Inc. (“Shopify”) you are agreeing to be bound by the following
      terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”). The Services offered by Shopify
      under the Terms of Service include various products and services to help
      you create and manage a retail store, whether an online store (“Online
      Services”), a physical retail store (“POS Services”), or both. Any new
      features or tools which are added to the current Service shall be also
      subject to the Terms of Service. You can review the current version of the
      Terms of Service at any time at https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms.
      Shopify reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service by
      posting updates and changes to the Shopify website. You are advised to
      check the Terms of Service from time to time for any updates or changes
      that may impact you.
    </p>
  </Scrollable>
</Card>
```

### Scroll to child component

Use when you need to programmatically scroll a child component into view in the scrollable container.

```jsx
<Card title="Terms of service" sectioned>
  <Scrollable shadow style={{height: '100px'}}>
    <ol>
      <li>Account Terms</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You must be 18 years or older or at least the age of majority in the
      jurisdiction where you reside or from which you use this Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access and use the Services, you must register for a Shopify account
      (“Account”) by providing your full legal name, current address, phone
      number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated as
      required. Shopify may reject your application for an Account, or cancel an
      existing Account, for any reason, in our sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that Shopify will use the email address you provide as the
      primary method for communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for keeping your password secure. Shopify cannot and
      will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to maintain
      the security of your Account and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for all activity and content such as photos, images,
      videos, graphics, written content, audio files, code, information, or data
      uploaded, collected, generated, stored, displayed, distributed,
      transmitted or exhibited on or in connection with your Account
      (“Materials”).
    </p>
    <p>
      A breach or violation of any term in the Terms of Service, including the
      AUP, as determined in the sole discretion of Shopify will result in an
      immediate termination of your services.
    </p>
    <p>Which means</p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for your Account and any Materials you upload to the
      Shopify Service. Remember that with any violation of these terms we will
      cancel your service.
    </p>

    <p>If we need to reach you, we will send you an email.</p>

      Subject to section 2.1.2, the person signing up for the Service will be
      the contracting party (“Account Owner”) for the purposes of our Terms of
      Service and will be the person who is authorized to use any corresponding
      account we may provide to the Account Owner in connection with the
      Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are signing up for the Service on behalf of your employer, your
      employer shall be the Account Owner. If you are signing up for the Service
      on behalf of your employer, then you represent and warrant that you have
      the authority to bind your employer to our Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>2.2 PayPal Express Checkout and Shopify Payments Accounts</p>

    <p>
      Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Shopify will create a PayPal
      Express Checkout account on your behalf, using your email address.
      Depending on your location, Shopify may also create a Shopify Payments
      account on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that PayPal Express Checkout and/or Shopify Payments will
      be your default payments gateway(s) and that it is your sole
      responsibility as the Account Owner to activate and maintain these
      accounts. If you do not wish to keep either of the payment accounts
      active, it is your responsibility to deactivate them. For the avoidance of
      doubt, PayPal Express Checkout is a Third Party Service, as defined in
      Section 15 of these Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <p>2.3 Apple Pay for Safari Account</p>

    <p>
      Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Shopify will create an Apple
      Pay for Safari (“Apple Pay”) account on your behalf, using the URL(s) and
      business name associated with your Account. Depending on your location,
      Shopify may activate your Apple Pay account on your behalf, otherwise you
      will be required to activate your Apple Pay account within your Account
      admin. If you do not wish to keep your Apple Pay account active, it is
      your responsibility to deactivate it. For the avoidance of doubt, Apple
      Pay is a Third Party Service, as defined in Section 15 of these Terms of
      Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use an Apple Pay supported payment gateway and your customers have
      enabled Apple Pay on their device, customers may purchase goods and
      services from your store using Apple Pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Apple Pay on your store, you are agreeing to be bound by the
      Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms and Conditions, as they may be
      amended by Apple from time to time. If Apple amends the Apple Pay Platform
      Web Merchant Terms and Conditions, the amended and restated version will
      be posted here:{' '}
      <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/apple-pay">
        https://www.shopify.com/legal/apple-pay

      . Such amendments to the Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms are effective
      as of the date of posting. Your continued use of Apple Pay on your store after
      the amended Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms are posted constitutes your
      agreement to, and acceptance of, the amended Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant
      Terms. If you do not agree to any changes to the Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant
      Terms, de-activate your Apple Pay account and do not continue to use Apple
      Pay on your store.

    <p>2.4 Google Payment</p>

    <p>
      Upon completion of sign up for the Service, if you have been enrolled in
      Shopify Payments, Shopify will also create a Google Payment account on
      your behalf. If you do not wish to keep your Google Payment account
      active, it is your responsibility to deactivate it. For the avoidance of
      doubt, Google Payment is a Third Party Service, as defined in Section 15
      of these Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use a Google Payment supported payment gateway and your customers
      have enabled Google Payment, customers may purchase goods and services
      from your store using Google Payment.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using Google Payment on your store, you are agreeing to be bound by the
      Google Payment API Terms of Service, as they may be amended by Google from
      time to time. If Google amends the Google Payment API Terms of Service,
      the amended and restated version will be posted here:{' '}
      <a href="https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos">
        https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos
      </a>
      . Such amendments to the Google Payment API Terms of Service are effective
      as of the date of posting. Your continued use of Google Payment on your store
      after the amended Google Payment API Terms of Service are posted constitutes
      your agreement to, and acceptance of, the amended Google Payment API Terms
      of Service. If you do not agree to any changes to the Google Payment API Terms
      of Service, de-activate your Google Payment account and do not continue to
      use Google Payment on your store.
    </p>

    <p>2.5 Domain Names</p>

    <p>
      Upon purchasing a domain name through Shopify, domain registration will be
      preset to automatically renew each year so long as your Shopify Account
      remains active. You acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to
      deactivate the auto-renewal function should you choose to do so.
    </p>
    <p>Which means</p>
    <p>
      The person signing up for the Shopify Service is responsible for the
      account and is bound by these Terms of Service. If you signup on behalf of
      your employer, your employer owns the account and is also bound by our
      Terms of Service.
