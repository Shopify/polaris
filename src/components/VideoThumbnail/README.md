# Video thumbnail

Video thumbnails provide consistent controls for video cards in the contextual learning system. When clicked, conditionally present a video player in the format of your choice. For example, within a modal or a full screen container.

## Best practices

- Use a thumbnail that helps to communicate the subject of the video or merchant benefit
- Use a video player with a thumbnail that helps to communicate the subject of the video or merchant benefit
- Be positioned at the bottom of the page to avoid getting in the way of a merchant task, unless used within an empty state

<!-- content-for: web -->

Images included in video thumbnails are implemented as decorative background images so that they’re skipped by screen readers.

The play button is keyboard accessible and the `aria-label` includes the video length when provided. For example, a video of length 1:20 is read as “Play video of length 1 minute and 20 seconds”. If no video length is provided, the default label reads “Play video”.
