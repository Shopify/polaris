# Resource picker

**For use with embedded apps only.** The resource picker component provides a search-based interface to help merchants find and select one or more products or collections, and communicate selected resources through callbacks the component accepts.

---

## Use in an embedded application (deprecated)

Enable the resource picker component to delegate to the [Shopify App Bridge](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/embedded-apps/app-bridge) by passing an API key to the [app provider component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/app-provider#section-initializing-the-shopify-app-bridge).

Use of the resource picker component is only supported in an embedded applicationâ€”it will not render in a stand-alone application. To help visualize the resource picker component in an embedded application, we've provided the following screenshot.

### Deprecation rationale

As of v3.17.0, `ResourcePicker` is deprecated. It will be removed in v5.0 as the underlying Shopify App Bridge library will be removed from Polaris React. Learn more about the [deprecation rationale](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/issues/814). Use [`ResourcePicker`](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/embedded-apps/app-bridge/react-components/resourcepicker) from [`@shopify/app-bridge-react`](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/embedded-apps/app-bridge/react-components) instead.

## Examples

### Product picker

When you ask for products, the `onSelection` callback is called with an object that has a `selection` key, which will have an array of objects detailing the selected products (even if `allowMultiple` is set to `false`).

```jsx
function EmbeddedAppResourcePickerExample() {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false);

  const handleResourcePickerClose = useCallback(() => setActive(false), []);

  const handleSelection = useCallback(
    ({selection}) => {
      console.log('Selected products: ', selection);
      handleResourcePickerClose();
    },
    [handleResourcePickerClose],
  );

  return (
    <AppProvider apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY" i18n={{}} shopOrigin="YOUR_SHOP_ORIGIN">
      <ResourcePicker
        resourceType="Product"
        open={active}
        onSelection={handleSelection}
        onCancel={handleResourcePickerClose}
      />
    </AppProvider>
  );
}
```
