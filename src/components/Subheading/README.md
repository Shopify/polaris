# Subheading

Subheadings are used for the title of any sub-sections in top-level page
sections. Generally, sections of a card use subheadings for their titles

---

## Best practices

Subheadings should:

- Be used to explain and clearly label logical groups in existing sections of a page
- Not be used without a parent heading
- Not be used in tables or list items, such as for the primary content in a [resource list](/components/lists-and-tables/resource-list)

---

## Content guidelines

Subheadings should be:

- Informative and descriptive: they should label the type of content grouped
  beneath them
- Concise and scannable:
  - Use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance
  - Keep subheadings to single sentence and avoid using punctuation such as
    periods, commas, or semicolons
  - Write in sentence case (first word capitalized, the rest lowercase)
