# Subheading

Subheadings are used for the title of any sub-sections in top-level page
sections. Generally, sections of a card use subheadings for their titles

---

## Best practices

Subheadings should:

- Be used to explain and clearly label logical groups in existing sections of a page
- Not be used without a parent heading
- Not be used in tables or list items, such as for the primary content in a [resource list](/components/lists-and-tables/resource-list)

---

## Content guidelines

Subheadings should be:

- Informative and descriptive: they should label the type of content grouped
  beneath them
- Concise and scannable:
  - Use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance
  - Keep subheadings to single sentence and avoid using punctuation such as
    periods, commas, or semicolons
  - Write in sentence case (first word capitalized, the rest lowercase)

<!-- content-for: web -->

A clear and consistent heading structure helps merchants who have difficulty with reading or language. It also helps screen reader users to navigate the page using keystrokes that are custom to their screen reader.

Use the `element` prop to determine the specific HTML element that’s output for the subheading. The component defaults to a level 3 heading (`<h3>`). Use a different value for the `element` prop if a different subheading fits the context better.

<!-- usageblock -->

#### Do

Use subheadings to support the hierarchy and structure of the page.

#### Don’t
