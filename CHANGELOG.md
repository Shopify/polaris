- Update build toolchain to use Babel v7, PostCSS v7 and Rollup v1. Update our build targets match our [supported browsers](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/intro-to-shopify/shopify-admin/supported-browsers), leading to a reduction in bundle size ([#837](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/pull/837))

## 3.0.0 - 2018-11-09

### Breaking changes

- Added padding top and bottom on `Card.Section` when set to full width
- Fixed `Portal` rendering by using `componentDidMount` lifecycle hook as opposed to `componentWillMount`
- Fixed an issue where clicking a `Link` without a `url` in a form would implicitly submit the form. `Link` can no longer submit forms. Use `<Button submit>` instead.
- Renamed the `Keys` enum to align with Shopify naming standards. It is now singular and the properties are in PascalCase. Replace `import {Keys} from '@shopify/polaris'` with `import {Key} from '@shopify/polaris'` and change the casing of the properties, e.g. replace `Keys.DOWN_ARROW` with `Key.DownArrow`.
- Added !important to `display: none` in `@print-hidden` mixin

#### Embedded apps

- Use the Shopify App Bridge in favor of the EASDK. The EASDK has been removed.
- Added Shopify App Bridge support to new components `Toast` and `Loading`
- Added `target` prop to all actions which get passed to the Shopify App Bridge
- Added new `size` and `message` props to `Modal` which aligns with the Shopify App Bridge API
- Added new `resourceType`, `initialQuery`, and `showVariants` props to `ResourcePicker` which aligns with the Shopify App Bridge API
- Moved embedded `ResourcePicker`, `Modal`, and `Page` to the main bundle and removed the embedded bundle. Imports from `'@shopify/polaris/embedded'` will no longer work, use `'@shopify/polaris'` instead.
- Made the `shopOrigin` prop on `AppProvider` optional. It’s now provided by default. If you do provide a `shopOrigin` it now needs to be given without the `'https://'` per the Shopify App Bridge API.
- Updated `onSelection` prop on `ResourcePicker`. The shape of the `selectPayload` data has changed and the product `id` is now a `gid`. For example, `/9019381572` is now `gid://shopify/Product/9019381572`. We offer [@shopify/admin-graphql-api-utilities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/admin-graphql-api-utilities) to help compose and parse `gid` from Shopify admin.
- Updated default values for `ResourcePicker` props to align with the Shopify App Bridge. Set the props `showHidden`, `allowMultiple={false}`, and `showVariants={false}` to get the previous default behavior.
- Updated `target` prop type related to embedded apps, use `'APP'`, `'ADMIN_PATH'`, or `'REMOTE'`
- Removed `icon` prop from `Page`. Upload your app’s icon in the Shopify Partners dashboard “App setup” section instead.
- Removed `title` prop from `ResourcePicker` as setting a title is no longer supported by the Shopify App Bridge
- Removed `products` prop from `ResourcePicker`, use `resourceType="Product"` instead
- Removed `collections` prop from `ResourcePicker`, use `resourceType="Collection"` instead
- Removed `width` and `height` props from `Modal`, use `size` instead
- Removed `debug` prop from `AppProvider`, use [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) instead. Redux DevTools also has [browser extensions](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).
- Removed the `Alert` component, use `Modal` with `message` prop instead
- Replaced `easdk` on React context with `appBridge`. Access it via `this.context.polaris.appBridge`.
- Removed `this.context.easdk.startLoading()` and `this.context.easdk.stopLoading()`, use the `Loading` component instead
- Removed `this.context.easdk.showFlashNotice()`, use the `Toast` component instead
- Removed `this.context.easdk.pushState()`, use the [Shopify App Bridge `History` action](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/embedded-apps/app-bridge/actions/navigation/history) instead. The `History` action requires passing the `appBridge` instance which is accessible via `this.context.polaris.appBridge`.
- Removed `this.context.easdk.redirect()`, use the [Shopify App Bridge `Redirect` action](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/embedded-apps/app-bridge/actions/navigation/redirect) instead. The `Redirect` action requires passing the `appBridge` instance which is accessible via `this.context.polaris.appBridge`.

#### License

- Updated the license from MIT to a custom license based on MIT. The new license restricts Polaris usage to applications that integrate or interoperate with Shopify software or services, with additional restrictions for external, stand-alone applications.

### New components

We’ve released a suite of new components that, when combined, form the application frame of a stand-alone (or non-embedded) Polaris app.

#### [Frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/frame)

The frame component, while not visible in the user interface itself, provides the structure for any non-embedded application. It wraps the main elements and houses the following components:

- primary [navigation](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/navigation)
- [top bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/top-bar)
- [toast](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/toast)
- [loading](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/loading)
- [contextual save bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/forms/contextual-save-bar)

#### [Navigation](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/navigation)

The navigation component is used to display the primary navigation in the sidebar of the [frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/frame) of any non-embedded application. Navigation includes a list of links that merchants use to move between sections of the application.

#### [TopBar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/top-bar)

The top bar component is always visible at the top of a non-embedded application. Its logo and color can be customized using the [app provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/app-provider) component to reflect an application’s brand. Merchants can use it to search an application, access menus, and navigate by clicking on the logo.

#### [Toast](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/toast)

The toast component is a non-disruptive message that appears at the bottom of the interface to provide quick, at-a-glance feedback on the outcome of an action.

#### [Loading](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/loading)

The loading component is used to indicate to merchants that a page is loading or an upload is processing.

#### [ContextualSaveBar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/forms/contextual-save-bar)

The contextual save bar tells merchants their options once they have made changes to a form on the page. This component is also shown while creating a new object like a product or customer. Merchants can use this component to save or discard their work.

#### [Autocomplete](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/forms/autocomplete)

The autocomplete component is an input field that provides selectable suggestions as a merchant types into it. It allows merchants to quickly search through and select from large collections of options.

### Enhancements

- Changed `Form` to default the `method` to `post` in order to prevent accidental leaking of form details
- Added support for boolean type on Choice error prop
- Changed the esnext folder to contain individual, minimally transpiled JavaScript component files, as well as raw style and image assets
- Added `onPortalCreated` prop to `Portal`

- Fixed the ability to upload multiple files even when `allowedMultiple` prop is false
- Fixed `Datatable` so it resizes with new content (thanks [@andrewpye](https://github.com/andrewpye) for the [original issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/issues/387))
- Fixed `RangeSlider` linear-gradient so it doesn’t break the css build (thanks [@Ankitjasoliya](https://github.com/Ankitjasoliya) and [@nerfologist](https://github.com/nerfologist) for the [original issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/issues/441))
- Fixed issue in `Page`, where styling wasn’t being applied correctly to Page Actions
- Removed unnecessary bindings on the `Modal`’s `onClose` prop
- Rearranged `primaryFooterAction` and `secondaryFooterAction` in `Card` (thanks [@sivakumar-kailasam](https://github.com/sivakumar-kailasam) for the [original issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/issues/551))

- Improvements to existing components, such as `ResourceList`, `ChoiceList`, and `Card`
- A few breaking API changes

### Breaking changes

#### React 16+

We’re removing support for React 15 in order to make full use of some of the new features in React 16, such as fragments, error boundaries, and improved server-side rendering.

##### Upgrade instructions

Upgrade your app to the latest version of React.

#### [App provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/app-provider)

The `AppProvider` component is now required in your app for Polaris components to function properly.

##### Upgrade instructions

Wrap your app in the `AppProvider` component.

#### [Collapsible](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/behavior/collapsible) component requires an `id` prop

For accessibility reasons, the `id` prop is now required on the `Collapsible` component.

##### Upgrade instructions

Pass a unique value as an `id` to all `Collapsible` components. For example, `<Collapsible id="my-unique-id">`.

#### EmbeddedApp component has been removed

The `EmbeddedApp` component has been removed. The `AppProvider` component now accepts the configuration needed to initialize an embedded app.

##### Upgrade instructions

Use the `AppProvider` component with the `apiKey` and `shopOrigin` props.

#### [Resource list](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists-and-tables/resource-list#navigation)

Shopify is organized around objects that represent a merchant’s business, such as customers, products, and orders. Each individual order, for example, is given a dedicated page that can be linked to. In Shopify, we call these types of objects resources.

The resource list component functions as:

- A content format, presenting a set of individual resources in a compact form
- A system for taking action on one or more individual resources
- A way to navigate to the details page of an individual resource

Our current resource list component gave you some nice defaults out of the box, but didn’t take you much further than that. We recognized that each of these lists is unique and contains different information that is important to the merchant.

Our new resource list allow you to build custom items in the list, with their own layout, content, and styling. This gives you a powerful way to build these sorts of lists going forward.

We’ve also included in depth documentation and a tutorial on how to build your own custom resource list items.

#### Tabs no longer accept `title` prop

To be more consistent with our other component APIs, the `Tabs` component now uses `content` instead of `title`.

##### Upgrade instructions

Change all instances of `title` to be `content` instead.

#### TextField onChange is required

Because we require you to manage state for your inputs, we decided to make `onChange` required for `TextField` to avoid confusion.

##### Upgrade instructions

Add an `onChange` callback to each use of `TextField` that is not disabled or readonly.

#### Removed default white color from Icon CSS

The CSS for `Icon` will no longer apply a color to icons by default. You must use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component to specify the color.

##### Upgrade instructions

Use `color` prop on all instances of `Icon` component.

#### Anchor tags are no longer styled by Polaris components

To avoid conflicts with other styling or frameworks, we’re removing the styling we globally applied to all `a` elements.

##### Upgrade instructions

Use the `Link` component instead.

#### Changed Alert onCancel prop to onClose

This change only impacts users of the Sass version of Polaris, more specifically the `color()` function. The `color($hue, $value: base, $for-background: null)` function in Sass now accepts strings for `$hue` and `$value` as advertised in [the color function documentation](https://polaris.shopify.com/sassdoc/#undefined-function-color).

##### Upgrade instructions

If you’re using VS Code, here are the exact search / replace instructions to follow (toggle “Use Regular Expression”):

- replace `\bcolor\(([a-z-]+)\)` with `color('$1')`
- replace `\bcolor\(([a-z-]+), ([a-z-]+)\)` with `color('$1', '$2')`
- replace `\bcolor\(([a-z-]+), ([a-z-]+), (.*)\)` with `color('$1', '$2', $3)`

### New components

#### [Data table](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists-and-tables/data-table)

Since launching Polaris components, we’ve had many people ask why we didn’t include tables. While we have been moving away from using tables for comparisons that aren’t tabular data (resource lists, for example), we recognize that there are still cases to use them.

The data table component is our answer to those cases. While data visualizations represents part of a data set, data tables are used to organize and display all the information from a data set, allowing merchants view details from the entire set. This helps merchants compare and analyze all the data in a unified way.

#### [Drop zone](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/drop-zone#navigation)

Currently we have several different interfaces for uploading files across Shopify, which leads to a lack of consistency and some missing features and capabilities. To solve this problem, we’re releasing a new drop zone component.

This new component allows merchants to upload files by dragging and dropping them into an area on a page. The component handles file type validation, dropping onto the window, and more, meaning more ease of use for merchants.

#### [Modal](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/modal#navigation)

In the original Polaris React, the modal component was only available to embedded apps. No longer. Our new modal component is universal in that it can be used in either stand-alone or embedded apps, and will handle the correct behavior for you.

#### [App provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/structure/app-provider#navigation)

The app provider is a required component that enables sharing global app config with the components in Polaris. This is used for the internationalization of strings in Polaris components, as well as set other configuration such as a custom link component that all the Polaris components will use. This unlocks new ways for us to share configuration at an app level and have the components react to that configuration.
