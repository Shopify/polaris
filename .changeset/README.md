`ðŸ¦‹  Which packages should have a major bump?`
- Press the `Enter` key to select none and move to the next question, _*or*_ navigate packages using the arrow keys and press the `Space` key to select the packages with changes that should target a major version.

`ðŸ¦‹  Which packages should have a minor bump?`
- Press the `Enter` key to select none so that your changes automatically target a patch bump, _*or*_ select packages using the up and down arrow keys and space if your changes should target a minor version.
